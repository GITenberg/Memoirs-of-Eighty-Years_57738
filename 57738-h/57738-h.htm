<h1><span class="smcap">Memoirs of Eighty Years.</span></h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_1">I.</h2>

<p>Several literary men of eminence have from time
to time suggested to me that I ought to write my
memoirs, but I have long held the opinion that
such works have scarcely a legitimate interest for
one’s contemporaries. Now, however, that I have
exceeded, by fourteen years, the age of man, I
begin to regard the opinion of others, and to look
upon myself as a sort of incipient posterity, and am
disposed to make the experiment of placing some
portion of my life on record.</p>

<p>Most people who attain to birth, parentage, and
education, find the latter the most doubtful of the
three, even the first being somewhat uncertain. For
myself, there is a tradition in my family that I was
born by candle-light on the 10th of March, 1809:
it was at midnight, and in the town of Leeds.</p>

<p>To keep those in order who believe too much,
Nature has issued a series of minds that believe too
little, and I am one of these; I could prove to the
satisfaction of any free metaphysician that I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
never existed at all, and that I am a mere optical
illusion, like the rest of my fellow-men.</p>

<p>As to my parentage, I believe in that implicitly.
But who else would be so credulous, if it were to his
interest to prove the reverse?</p>

<p>As to my education, it has been as scanty as
that of the best of us; it would be too great a joke
to suppose that eighty years is a sufficient time for
the acquisition of any knowledge worth naming.
Herschel, for example, discovered the planet Uranus;
that educated him, though it had been in the place
where he found it for countless millions of years.</p>

<p>The educated are those who appreciate things
at their true value; culture does not merely signify
knowledge, but its acquisition in the utmost detail.</p>

<p>My father was said to have a musical genius,
and rumour handed down that my mother fell in
love with him on that account. She was the most
emotional woman that I ever had the pleasure of
knowing, and I can understand her marrying at the
age of thirty-three a youth of nineteen, which she
did; but I cannot understand my father at his age
marrying her.</p>

<p>I had a sister; she was the firstborn, and a
brother who came after me.</p>

<p>My father died at the age of twenty-six; he got
his feet wet in the snow, took a chill, and went
regularly through all the stages of inflammation.</p>

<p>I was three years and three months old when
my father died; I remember him, also his house,
both inside and out, and the square where it stood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
at Sidmouth. But I have only one vision of these
things; it is always the same, that of the father, the
house, and the square.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_2">II.</h2>


<p>It is as well to know how one’s family dovetails
into the community of such a mosaic work as the
British, so I will set down what information I have
on the subject. I presume that a band of Hakes
quitted Prussian Saxony in the olden time for a less
sandy soil, and that some of them settled on the old
red sandstone of Devon. The name of Hache gave
itself to a town in the region of Broadcliss, and
received a notice in Doomsday-book. The family
no doubt occupied the soil thereabout for centuries,
the name being noticeable in the Broadcliss Register
in the time of Queen Anne. The name, too, is rife
in Saxony; at Stassfurt there is a Hake’s Bridge;
besides this there are numerous workmen of the
name, engaged in the salt factories, not to mention
a general and count who commanded the army
against the Danes in the Schleswig-Holstein affair.
In England, too, this family name has belonged to
all classes, from a viscount in the time of Edward I.,
an M.P. for Windsor and a poet, in the reign of
Henry VIII., down to some, who, being in trade,
my mother used to call “the scum of the earth.”</p>

<p>My great-grandfather is reputed to have had
land and a mansion called Bluehayes, hard by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Broadcliss; and tradition says it got merged into
the family of Acland by a successful mortgage on
their part. My family lived on the soil for many
centuries without being distinguished in any branch
of science, literature, or art.</p>

<p>My mother’s family have had a different career:
her father was a soldier, and the son of one; they
were Gordons of the Huntly stock, and came
directly from the Park branch of that house, but
how little meaning is there in a name! Truth to
tell the only male descendants of the first Gordon
are the Aberdeen family. In the reign of one
David, King of Scotland, a Norman prince of name
forgotten, settled on a territory called Gordon, north
of the Tweed. The elder branch failed after three
or four generations; an only daughter succeeding to
the territory, married a Seton, of Seton, who took
the name of Gordon, so that this branch, the most
successful one, having become barons, earls, marquisses,
and finally dukes, are a younger branch of
the Setons; baronets of Touch, still existing, while
the Aberdeens, the second branch of Gordon, are
the true descendants.</p>

<p>The centuries that have elapsed must have
wholly eradicated the blood of Gordon in this family
that still bears the name, and had the marquisate
from early Scottish kings, whose daughter one of
them married: Arabella.</p>

<p>There is something very dry in family history,
because no one cares for other people’s relations.
What I note down is to show that I belong to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
classes. I have a cousin who is a baronet named
Key; another who is an earl named Ranfurly;
and, as I was told, one of my family was a butcher
named Bedford. In fact, while not a true Briton,
which I am glad of, I have a full share to my name
of the Saxon blood. As regards my mother’s
family, they were comparatively obscure in the
middle of this century, and are so still, except in
the instance of one individual who has a statue
in Trafalgar Square, set up by the Conservative
Government in perpetual disapproval of the neglect
which the hero of Khartoum experienced at the
hands of the Gladstone-Granville administration.
But for that he would have been, like Cromwell,
without a statue. Of him I shall give my opinion
in the proper place; and as his name is public
property, I shall trace some of the families from
which, in common with him, I have derived my
origin.</p>

<p>I may say, then, that our grandfather, Captain
William Augustus Gordon, was an officer somewhat
distinguished in the service. He was at the taking
of Moro Castle, Havanna, Louisburg, and Quebec.
At the siege of Quebec he was on the staff of
General Wolf, and saw him die happy. He retired
early from the army, in which he made many
powerful friends—married a lady of many high
qualities and great personal beauty, named Clarke,
whose family belonged to Hexham, in Northumberland,
the sister of the Rev. Slaughter Clarke,
incumbent of that place, at whose house he first met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
her while stationed in the town on military duty.
He had a family by her of four daughters and three
sons, of which my mother was the firstborn.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_3">III.</h2>


<p>I had a sister; she came two or three years
before me, and died at the age of four or five and
twenty, of typhoid fever. She was attended, but in
vain, by men of skill—Dr. J. A. Wilson, physician
to St. George’s, and Mr. Nussey, the king’s
apothecary.</p>

<p>Then I have a brother, who came last—two
years after me—my oldest friend.</p>

<p>We both had good abilities, as time has since
shown, but being let to run wild, we had no serious
use for them, so we devoted them to mischief. It
seems a settled purpose in nature for children to
destroy whatever things they can lay their hands
on, by way of testing the strength of materials, and
to privately annoy all who come within their reach,
not out of wickedness, but for fun. I and my
brother fully entered into these views, and did all
in our power to assist them; the consequence was,
we were a good deal disliked. Another failing that
we indulged in was a love of the village boys’
society, and this caused us to be looked down on by
gentlemen’s sons. The street boys we found the
best company, and they were amenable to our
orders, which could not be said of the genteel class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>All this is defensible in children who are allowed
to follow their own devices, and is a sign of health,
for good little boys and girls are never very well.
There is no intellectual endowment of such value as
a sense of the ridiculous; it argues the existence
of imagination, to which it is a supplement and
corrective.</p>

<p>Can any one say he has more than one friend
who makes him part of himself? I have one—my
brother. I used to say once, “If you want friends,
you must breed them;” but experience tells us that
this method has only an average success. Acquired
friends must be engrafted in youth, or before, while
growth is going on. Friendships made later are
only impressions; they are not an integral part of
us; and, though they may flourish, are liable to be
overturned. Stately as they may become, like the
elm, they have no tap-root.</p>

<p>I said, the other day at dinner, before one of my
brother’s sons, but playfully, “I and my brother are
fonder of each other than we are of our own
children; but we have known each other longer
than we have known them.”</p>

<p>A child to be healthy should not be too clever;
he should only have receptive power and humour.
How grown-up children even differ in this respect!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_4">IV.</h2>


<p>Soon after I was seven I went away to school.
My mother had inherited a small income in bank-stock,
and was able to go where she liked, which she
did freely. It was now Exmouth, now Teignmouth,
Dawlish, Budleigh Salterton, Tiverton, and other
places, but she never found peace of mind in any.
She was throughout a long life in search of the Ideal
which she never found, and she handed the passion
with the same result down to me. She had a
married sister, named Wallinger, at Gainsborough;
so she took us there. This sister, a year younger
than herself, played the great lady throughout as
long a life as my mother’s: her husband, Captain
Wallinger, was the son of the Wallinger of Hare
Hall in Essex, a county family; he had been in
the Dragoon Guards, and at a venture might
be called the finest and handsomest man of his
time.</p>

<p>I remember the house where we lived at Gainsborough,
and that of the Wallingers, so well, that I
could describe both to the satisfaction of an artist,
together with the surroundings, and the roads leading
to them, not forgetting a white wooden bridge
that spanned the Trent, and which we crossed in
due time in a post-chaise into Yorkshire, where we
visited relations, the Rimingtons of Hillsborough,
near Sheffield, the beautiful grounds of which are
now, perhaps, cut up for buildings by a knife-grinding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
population. A descendant of this family is
Rimington Wilson of Bromhead, a famed grouse
manor; another is Lord Ranfurly. I remember
even sitting on the left side of the carriage, and
looking out of the window at the water as we crossed
the Trent.</p>

<p>One does not read faces from an early age,
but I have a good recollection of certain features;
for instance, I can recall our “cousin” Rimington’s
powdered head. But after I was seven, I never
forgot a face, and often knew schoolfellows again,
despite the changes time had worked, whom I had
not met for half a century.</p>

<p>It is not the features one recollects, but the
demeanour and general expression. One does not,
as a rule, observe the features of others. A man
who had seen me every day for a year, said, “Well,
I always imagined your eyes were blue, but I now
observe that they are hazel.”</p>

<p>In his novel of “Coningsby” Disraeli has introduced
the character of Sir Joseph Wallinger, the
same Christian name as my uncle’s. There being no
other family of that name, I have often felt curious
to learn what circumstance led him to its selection.
He may have been a visitor at Hare Hall in his
younger days. I shall have occasion to revert
frequently to the Wallingers.</p>

<p>We made a long visit to the Rimingtons; I
retain the recollection of it as one of much enjoyment.
I remember the housekeeper promising me a penny
if I would sit still for an hour, which I did, and lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
my money five minutes after while rolling it about
the floor; a suggestive episode. I remember Mr.
Rimington giving me sixpence, which I no sooner
got than I dropped it into a water-tank beyond
recovery, as many have done since who have shares
in submarine telegraph companies.</p>

<p>This wealthy family, which must still dwell in
the memory of many Sheffielders, had only one son,
whose three children may still live, with the exception
of Lady Ranfurly; the eldest is Rimington of
Bromhead Hall, with the suffix of Wilson.</p>

<p>Bromhead Hall manor must have the best
grouse shooting in Yorkshire, except that of
Studley Royal. My grandmother’s sister, Mrs.
Wilson, was our cousin Rimington’s mother, and
was a very stately lady. She lived at Upper
Tooting, where I once spent my holidays with her
when I was at school in London. One day, after a
drive with her, she said, “Remember, you have had
a ride in your aunt Wilson’s carriage;” and these
are the only words of hers that I have borne in
memory.</p>

<p>My grandmother, Mrs. Gordon, had two brothers
besides the one already named—William and
Henry Clarke, of the City of London. William was
one of the Mercers’ Company, and is buried in
their ground at Mercers’ Hall. He lived at 72,
Gracechurch Street, with his brother, who carried
on a business in the stationery trade, and made
money. His elder brother was rich, leaving over
a hundred thousand pounds, but was never in trade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
These brothers died unmarried, and their wealth
reached the next generation, the elder attaining the
age of ninety-five.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_5">V.</h2>


<p>That uncle of mine, William Clarke, whom I
never saw but in the back room on the first floor of
72, Gracechurch Street, had a proud temper. His
father went into business in King Street, Guildhall,
and was cut by the father before him for so
doing, which father was a general, and paymaster
to Queen Anne’s forces, with a residence in Kew
Palace. My mother’s immediate uncle was introduced
into his father’s business, that of a whalebone
merchant, but quitted it suddenly on being asked
by a customer to abate a price; his reply being,
“Do you think it was stolen?” He played a part
in life which still influences posterity, and will do so
more and more, if only through one act of his life,
that of giving a presentation to the first Sir
Frederick Pollock for St. Paul’s School. Proud as
he was, he had a good heart, though a churl; he
was careful even to meanness; he was charitable
towards those who needed it most, preferring the
poor to such of his own kith and kin as were not
well off. Indeed he left thousands to charitable
institutions, and very little to any of his relations
except one, the only nephew who preserved his
name, though his intentions were ultimately frustrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
by the death of his heir, and that, at a period
of his life when he was no longer competent to
design a will. But he did a great thing in sending
the young Pollock to St. Paul’s School, whence the
boy proceeded to Cambridge, and became one of
the hundred senior wranglers of his own century.
The genius of the Pollock family was ripe for breaking
out; the brother of the future Chief Baron, Sir
George Pollock, became a distinguished general,
and, I think, died a field-marshal, a rank borne for
a long time by the Duke of Wellington alone, who
could tolerate no rival. Sir Frederick Pollock was
<i>facile princeps</i> in his profession, and from him have
sprung lawyers of mark for three generations, not
the least promising of these, as report goes, the
present or third baronet, son of a good, great, and
noble-minded sire, lately lost to the world; and it
must not be forgotten that the name is great in
medicine, that profession which is more enlightening
than all the others put together, involving, as it
does, an adequate knowledge of every science. It
is not to be forgotten, either, that one of the most
cultivated men of the day, a true poet and the
possessor of a unique literary talent in fantastic
caricature, is to be found in Walter Herries Pollock,
a younger brother of the present baronet.</p>

<p>Either William Clarke or his brother Henry,
who were both governors of Christ’s Hospital, supplied
me with my early education by nominating me
to that remarkable school. They might have put
me also to St. Paul’s, though I might not, certainly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
have done them the credit they must have enjoyed
from giving a presentation to the young Pollock.
What the elder did for my mother was always with
a high hand; if he sent her money it was with covert
insult, nevertheless circumstances compelled her to
be grateful and to say as much in return, and she
certainly had the best of it in so doing. I must
acquit all who act in like manner of wanting spirit,
in accepting needful favours done with an ill grace.
None of us feel resentful towards Nature for giving
us our carrots, our turnips, our potatoes, covered
with dirt!</p>

<p>I was given in charge of a clergyman from
Exeter to London, the Rev. Mr. Back, who took
his own son to the school at the same time. I
remember absolutely nothing of my journey, over
173 miles, except that on the road the coach met a
drove of cows, and that I said to myself, “This will
be something to tell my mother.” This occurrence
has stuck to my memory ineradicably, like a daub
of paint. But I remember the date without ever
having refreshed it: the 20th of June, 1816.</p>

<p>In those days the journey occupied twenty-four
hours; as I started in the morning I must have
reached town in the morning, and being destined
for Hertford, where the younger boys of my tender
age were sent, I must have been conveyed there
the same day, but I recollect nothing that happened
till in bed at No. 1 ward, under Nurse Merenith.</p>

<p>But the almost regal school and oblong gravelled
ground, with buildings in front and on each side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
faced with trees, and enclosed in lofty iron railings,
I see still; as I saw on being turned loose the next
day.</p>

<p>When at home in the enjoyment of freedom, I
was riotous; when at school, in the hands of
strangers, I was meek. I feared my writing and
cyphering master, Mr. Whittle. The usher, who
took a dislike to me, never missed an opportunity
of striking me a blow. Less I feared my classical
master, Dr. Franklin, a tall man of noble deportment,
with a florid complexion, and a face that
never relaxed during school hours, but was full of
play the moment school was over. I recollect well
my astonishment at seeing the boys following him
in crowds as he marched to his house in his
doctor’s gown, while they tugged at his robes,
seized on his hands, and made free with him as if
he were their father; he enjoying these liberties
not less than the boys themselves.</p>

<p>I was at once put into Greek and Latin grammar,
with delectuses; and then into Æsop. But while
on those amusing fables I sickened of measles;
from this I had scarcely convalesced when I was
down with scarlet fever. This burnt itself out of
my blood, but left me prostrate, and, as I learned, I
was sent home to my mother to die; all of which
seemed to me very natural.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_6">VI.</h2>


<p>Let me here remark, as a physician, that, had
not my constitution been faultless, the scarlet fever
would have seized on my kidneys or my heart, and
have maimed me for life, allowing me, perhaps,
twenty years in which to complete my survey of the
world. But I passed unscathed through the ordeal,
a sort of inoculation that renders one death-proof so
long as it is not worth while to die. How did I
get home through that long journey? In doing so
I anticipated a two days’ instalment of my now near-approaching
oblivion.</p>

<p>My recovery was rapid, and, now that I had a
brother as my familiar, I was ready to set him a bad
example, and to perpetrate whatever mischief our
united talents could invent. Our most obvious
opportunity was, after we had watched our neighbour
at Heavitree sweeping his gravel walks, to
throw rubbish on them over the fence, that he
might have the labour in which he delighted, over
again. We would then retire unseen, and, as we
thought, into the security of non-detection, too young
to know the value of circumstantial evidence. But
the nonsense of children is little worth repeating,
except to babes, and I cannot emulate those
wonderful geniuses who can even turn metaphysics
into fairy tales. I cannot resist giving an account
of the finest ride I ever had in my life.</p>

<p>It was at Heavitree, where, near the churchyard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and parsonage, there was a large meadow, which I
and my brother often crossed on our rambles. One
day we encountered a large sow there. I coaxed
my way up to it, and leapt on to its back, when it
started off at a tremendous gallop, needing neither
whip nor spur. My seat kept safe, and I was
carried round the meadow at a fabulous pace, no
doubt amid gruntings the most terrific. This ride
seemed to realize in me a state of existence surpassing
all common pleasure; it was a taste of
glory.</p>

<p>My leave of funereal absence, which was so soon
converted into a holiday, was prolonged without
difficulty on the certificate of Mr. Harris, a leading
surgeon of Exeter, who was good nature itself; but
he must have seen that I was malingering. I must
have remained at home nearly a year. By this
time I was intelligent enough to understand my
mother and her history, and my brother was not
behind me in that respect. She instilled into our
minds a contempt for the Hake family, some of
whom were in trade; but this was most unjust, for
their moral tone was high, and they were a credit to
the middle class. Their position in life had changed
since the generation previous; but family pride had
remained to them, and that is sometimes the parent
of honour—if not its father, its mother at least. On
the other hand, she was never tired of her own
family distinction; her father and two of her
brothers, the third being still a boy, had in her
eyes the attributes of nobility. But all this was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the warmth of her own imagination and love; for no
one else thought so. They were respectable and
respected—that was all. Those who are really great
are not aware of it, for it never occupies their
thoughts.</p>

<p>The time came for me to be returned to my
owners, the masters of the school—a change that
gave me neither pleasure nor pain. I cannot recall
the time when I did not feel myself the subject of
destiny against which I had no instinct of resistance.
So amenable was I to the mastery of circumstances,
that all things happened as a matter of course, and
I knew no protest. When my illnesses began, I
was the subject of diarrhœal disorder, and I was
brutally treated. I was put into a room with a tub
of cold water to cleanse my miserable self, when
the boys, hearing of my wretched plight, broke in
upon me with a broom, and did the work of scrubbing
me. My feeling was that I must bear it; my consolation
was that it would not last. Soon afterwards
I was taken to the sick ward and treated with
humanity.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_7">VII.</h2>


<p>My governor, as was called the one who gave
a boy his presentation, made an attempt to have
me kept in London, but I was still thought too
young, and I reached Hertford again, where I
remained for perhaps another year; but after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
August holidays, I was established in the Newgate
Street school.</p>

<p>The Wallingers had settled at Seaford, in a
house on the Crouch, to which a good garden was
attached, and in this my uncle plied the spade and
grew vegetables. It was a gentlemanly residence,
standing high and overlooking the sea.</p>

<p>At Seaford I spent my first holidays, and made
a large acquaintance there. It was the property
of the Earl of Chichester and Mr. Ellis, and it
returned two members to the House of Commons
at the dictation of its owners. Mr. Canning once
had the honour of representing, I cannot say the
borough, but the gentlemen to whom it belonged.
During his proprietorship Mr. Ellis was created
Lord Seaford; he afterwards succeeded to the family
title of Howard de Walden.</p>

<p>A row of houses led from the beach up to the
Crouch on the left side; opposite to this was an
open field. One of these houses Mr. Ellis kept as
his occasional residence. It was entirely in the
French style, had a long walled garden, and was
very picturesque. The man cook of this gentleman
sometimes visited Seaford, and took up his abode
in the family house, bringing with him his hounds
and horses.</p>

<p>A cousin of mine, Henry Shore, who was also
in the school, passed the August holidays at Seaford
with our relations. His mother was the youngest
of the four Miss Gordons. She married into a
very considerable family, the Shores of Maresbrook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Park, near Sheffield, an elder branch, of which the
younger was Shore of Tapton, who took the name,
afterwards, of Nightingale. He had two daughters,
Florence and Penelope. The first of these, as is
well known, remained single; the second married
Sir Harry Verney.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to mention that these
ladies took their names from the country of their
birth, the one being born at Florence, the other at
Athens.</p>

<p>This was my first opportunity of learning my
aunt’s character, which was a very singular one.
It was necessary to her that she should be the first
person in her circle, wherever that lay. At Seaford
she found no difficulty. It was then an obscure town
with a few good families in it, among them the
clergyman, the Reverend Mr. Carnegie and his wife;
Mr. Verral, the surgeon, a man of great talent and
skill, with his wife and children; and Captain
Evans, the agent of the borough owners, whose
business it was to see that the taxes were paid up,
or to pay them himself, ready for an election, and
never to press for rent. Then there were gentlemen
farmers in the neighbourhood, a peculiar class—men
of capital and education, devoted chiefly to
the breeding of sheep. Every one has heard of
Southdown mutton; in those days it was in plenty.
Ellman of Glynde and Lord Chichester were great
among its producers, and it was never killed till it
was six years old. No venison equalled it in
flavour, and, regrettable to say, it is now unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in the market; if it still exists in perfection, it may
be at Stanmer Park and at Glynde.</p>

<p>The greatest of our aunt’s accomplishments was
keeping house—of all else she was ignorant in
the extreme; but, by the aid of a small dictionary,
she kept the spelling of her letters pretty correct,
and by tact she concealed her ignorance of all
human knowledge. She expected to be looked
up to by her neighbours, and she required this
homage of her relations, one and all. I and my
cousin had to meet a heavy tax to retain her
favour. She would spoil our morning by sending
us on errands to her tradesmen, not in
one round, but to one at a time, with a written
order, which held us on the trudge up to the time
of luncheon. She made us her <i>pensionnaires</i>, and
she had the firm belief that she honoured and
delighted us in thus keeping us employed. Her
remaining sister, Mrs. Gwynne, lived at Denton,
a village on the Newhaven side of the downs,
three miles off. The Rev. William Gwynne,
the husband of this lady, was the rector of the
parish.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wallinger was very fond of this sister, who
was a cautious and sentimental flatterer, and witty
beyond all common measure. She was never at a
loss for anecdotes of the most amusing kind. Her
husband was a stout, showy man, a good talker
and a lover of wine, which did not suffice him
without a long double nightcap of brandy, gin, or
rum. He and Captain Wallinger adapted themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
admirably to each other, and the two families
met at each other’s table often.</p>

<p>There was a houseful of children at Denton
Rectory, ending in five sons and two daughters,
brought up without a view to education, both boys
and girls. Notwithstanding this, one of the five
sons became an Australian judge, and another
entered the Church, though at first an M.D. Mr.
Gwynne had a passion for shooting; he cared more
for his dogs than for his own cubs. He was,
however, a kind man, with a manner that made him
appear interested in every one he met with.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_8">VIII.</h2>


<p>As I have got so near to the remarkable family
of Gwynnes, I must say a few more words about
them.</p>

<p>Mr. Gwynne was one of six brothers and two
sisters. One brother was a very artful lawyer of
imposing demeanour, and was highly respected by
all who did not know him.</p>

<p>Another brother, whose position in life—the
head of the Legacy Office—was so good that all
men spoke well of him, married a not good-looking
Jewess. A third brother was also in the law, but
the time came when he forewent his licence, perhaps
owing to some irregularities in his practice; but he
was the most true-hearted of the lot, and had one
of the sweetest of daughters. He had a practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
still, but it was attended with certain disabilities.
Two brothers remained; both attained rank in the
East India Company’s service. They were, like
the rest, very fine men, and, being soldiers, they
were of unimpeachable honour.</p>

<p>Then there were two sisters, who, as is always
the case in slack families, were a credit to society.
These two ladies were both well settled in life.</p>

<p>My uncle was the most unfortunate of the
family; too much for the day was the good thereof,
so he allowed his affairs to drift in whatever
direction they liked, and that was towards bankruptcy,
of course.</p>

<p>He was indulgent towards his family, though
perhaps a little ironical towards his wife, who would
repeat all that passed concerning him with the
greatest glee. After a quarrel, in which he said
ill-natured things, she would say, “If that is your
opinion of me, Gwynne, why did you marry me?”
“My dear Henrietta,” he would reply, “it was
for your present beauty and your future expectations.”
And she would tell this story with fits of
laughter.</p>

<p>These, my uncle and aunt, were frequent guests
at Glynde, the residence of a Lord and Lady
Hampden, who took much pleasure in Mrs. Gwynne’s
society on account of her great wit.</p>

<p>One evening, after dinner, Lady Hampden spoke
warmly in favour of one of the farmers, dwelling on
his truthfulness and honesty.</p>

<p>“My dear Lady Hampden,” said Mrs. Gwynne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
“you do not know that man; I can assure you that,
with the exception of my dear husband, he is the
greatest liar in the county.”</p>

<p>My uncle, Captain Wallinger, would sometimes
drive me over to Denton, and we generally reached
the parsonage in time to see a general rush of the
boys from the house and premises. They were so
dirty, so ill-clad and unkempt, they did not dare to
face their uncle. Mr. Gwynne was seldom at home;
his time was fully employed in keeping appointments
with dog-fanciers, horse-dealers, gunsmiths,
and the like. He allowed the parish to take care
of itself, or to be cared for by the farmers or his
wife; and as he preached <i>extempore</i>, he had no
sermons to prepare. He was very fluent, which he
accounted for by saying that he looked at the
congregation as he would do on a field of cabbage-stalks.
I have no doubt that, when preaching to
others, he was sincere, and that he preached to
himself at the same time. But he was not one of
those self-martyrs who annoy themselves through
life with religious dogmas. Still, he was not a mere
agnostic in canonicals, but true to his belief, though
he did not avail himself personally of this advantage.</p>

<p>There was not a tree in the village, except a
willow that wept over a mud pond on the roadside
by the church, as some sanctified parties do over
the worthless dead; yet Denton could be compared
to nothing but the backwoods of a colony, so rugged
an aspect did the Gwynne boys give to the place.
They were the talk of the neighbourhood for miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
around. They could, nevertheless, satirize and
very cleverly mock those who looked down on their
doings. One or two of them, once on a visit at
the Wallingers’, followed their aunt, by invitation,
up to the drawing-room. She knew them of old,
and while they ascended the stairs she turned
round suddenly, when she met the sight she expected—one
was making hideous faces at her, the
other was squaring his fists at her back.</p>

<p>“Dear me! You seem amused,” was her only
reproof; but she secretly enjoyed it, for everything
was grateful to her that stamped others as her
inferiors.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_9">IX.</h2>


<p>I was now to enter on a new life. My home
was to be a monastic one, which three hundred
years before had been the residence of mitred
abbots. A king had expelled these from their
Gothic dominion; another and a better king had
given it to his children, among whom in these latter
days were Coleridge, Leigh Hunt, and Charles
Lamb. And now I was to be there, to tread in
their steps, to pace the same ancient cloisters, to
catch the same earnest mood in pacing them.</p>

<p>The place was more like a university than a
school. Four classical masters to teach us the
languages of Athens and Rome; two writing-masters,
who themselves wrote like copper-plate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and made us do likewise, besides teaching us
figures.</p>

<p>Then we had playgrounds by the acre. One
looking on Little Britain through lofty palisades,
on which same ground were the residences of the
masters and of certain dignitaries, among them that
of the treasurer, always a City magnate, and to us
inscrutably great. The counting-house was in the
grounds, as well as the head and junior master’s
houses, together with the office and house of the
steward. With all these buildings, the playground
was not crowded; and apart, in the large open
space on the north side, stood the grammar school.</p>

<p>Now that the institution is to be removed, the
character of the boys will change, and all its traditions
end. The cloisters and garden within their
quadrangle, with the monkish dormitories and other
old places, have hitherto shaped the minds of the
boys, and this influence will cease, and the feeling
will vanish that the school owed its foundation to a
king. It was in this feeling that the pride of the
boys lay; it indulged them in the belief that they
were superior to all other boys. They thought of
their royal founder almost as if they were descended
from him, and honoured their very dress from its
similarity to that which the youthful sovereign
himself wore.</p>

<p>In my time the cloisters were Gothic, as originally
built; half a century ago they were reconstructed
into Saxon or some other contemptible
pattern, which has perpetuated the architect’s ignorance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
insensibility, and bad taste up to the present.
But it signifies little; all will be swept away and
covered with shops, where the name of Homer will
nevermore be heard. But Parliament, in sympathy
with open spaces, may grant the necessary million.
Not they!</p>

<p>But nothing was intended to last for ever, if we
except—what?</p>

<p>The genius of the place affected me very soon,
I felt myself growing into monkhood. I preferred
the sombre cloister to the playground, and for that
reason I often had to be alone there, not in steady
thought, but under involuntary emotions which ran
through me like an underground current. Then,
the suggestiveness of some of the inscriptions on
the walls, thus, “Here lies a benefactor, let no one
move his bones.” This I used to regard as a very
pathetic appeal, as if the bones were very comfortable
where they were yet in constant dread of being
disturbed. Had nothing been said they might have
been safer from the antiquarian.</p>

<p>But I should mention that the first ordeal I was
put through was to fight. Every boy knew whom
he could fight; this was required of him for the
benefit of his public. A boy named Yardley was
selected to test my pugnacious powers. We were
of a height, both tall, and of about the same age.
We were taken into a private yard. Of fighting I
knew nothing; but I had a quick eye and was quick
of limb. More than this I had dramatic imagination,
and to this it was that I owed my victory. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
pictured to myself a tiger springing at his prey, and
with this example I leapt at my antagonist from
some distance, and my fists covered his face and
eyes almost before he knew that I was upon him.
He had not a moment’s chance, he floundered each
time that I was upon him.</p>

<p>This encounter was never forgotten by the boys,
and I was never asked to fight again.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_10">X.</h2>


<p>Theodore Watts, as he told me twenty years
ago, holds the opinion that Shakespeare wrote
private poetry in a separate book while composing
his dramas, and that he gave such portions of it as
he could make fit, to certain of his characters. He
thought, if I remember aright, that the soliloquy
and the dagger-scene were morsels of this sort. It
certainly must strike one that “the law’s delay”
and “the insolence of office” were not prominent
grievances in Hamlet’s career.</p>

<p>When I was about eleven years old I became
owner of Rowe’s “Shakespeare,” which has in it a
wonderful little life of the bard. He quotes the
marvellous passage beginning with—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“She never told her love,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and, as far as memory serves me, it was to declare
that poetry of such exquisite beauty was not to be
found in any other writer, ancient or modern. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
have since often thought that nothing in the context
fairly led up to an idea of such magnitude,
and that the passage was one of Shakespeare’s interpolations.
Be this as it may, it had an elevating
effect on me which has lasted me for life; it gave
me a sense of perfect excellence. It may appear
ridiculous to say that it not only made me envious
of the greatest of writers, but that it depressed me,
in turn, with the feeling that I could never equal it,
however long I might live!</p>

<p>No other writer at that time affected me similarly,
except Virgil, when I came to that passage
which depicts the breaking of the waves on the
prow of the vessel and the receding of the cities
and lands (<i>terræque urbesque recedunt</i>). After we
reached our beds at night the boys were wont to
“coze” in literary cliques round some favourite
tale-teller, who would relate marvellous stories of
knights and ladies, with much about genii, fairies,
and witches. Though I never heard anything to
that effect, I have always thought that Coleridge
must have lent himself to such delights for the
pleasure of others, and that “Christabel” was unconsciously
an outcome of these romantic entertainments.</p>

<p>Many of the boys were great readers of forbidden
story, and smuggled books into the school,
the penalty of which, on being found out, was a
flogging. The books in question were romances
of enchanted castles; of beautiful young women, the
prisoners of tyrants; of subterraneous passages and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
solitary cells. I would give much to possess a
circulating library of that day. Such a one I found
at Seaford, and devoured whenever my holidays
came round. The novel, as reintroduced by Plumer
Ward, and imitated greedily by Bulwer and Disraeli,
was then unknown.</p>

<p>“Tremaine,” like all new conceptions which are
accordant with the average mentality of great
Britons, became epidemic, and floated over the
reading world as a new sensation. It was succeeded
by “De Vere,” while Walter Scott was winding up
the business of romance. The success of these
works started a fresh “novel” epoch, now, too,
worn out, only lingering till such successors as
Walter Besant and Louis Stevenson are ready to
sweep them from view. This is so true that it is
almost a disgrace to write a novel.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be forgotten that Dickens
fired a bomb into library shelves, and that Thackeray
gave us his own character in novelistic shape.</p>

<p>All great things appear in epochs, which hitherto
have had a limited duration. Witness the rise and
fall of sculpture in Greece, of epic and drama there;
of painting in Italy, beginning with Titian and
Raphael as late as the sixteenth century; of music
in Germany and Italy, now on the point of extinction.
Poetry, too, has had its day from Shakespeare to
Coleridge, and is now dead. The present is the
epoch of invention, and that will die out.</p>

<p>Music has never been of the highest quality in
a free country. The northern nations, England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
America, the great Colonies, produce no musical
genius; Italy and Germany have ceased to do so
since they came into the enjoyment of freedom.</p>

<p>Science itself, now rampant, is but of an epoch.
But, amid all this, religion is enduring.</p>

<p>Some will say, We now have the Press; that
will maintain and resuscitate all that is good or
beautiful! Not so; it is but of an epoch, and is
already <i>blasé</i>. It does not lead; it only “follows
the leader,” as in a game played by a child.</p>

<p>Nothing that has been and has died out, will
be revived. The skeleton, an osseous Apollo, will
remain, and that is all.</p>

<p>These dry bones cannot live, O son of man!</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_11">XI.</h2>


<p>The masters of the school in my time were a
certain set of reverends named Rice, Lynam, and
the Trollopes. I was more or less under all, none
of whom were in sympathy with boys. Rice was
called “cuddy,” a word in our vocabulary signifying
“severe.” He beat the boys with a fury worthy of
a bastard son of the Eumenides.</p>

<p>To see that man of the fist, rod, and cane
spending his force on a little boy, now leaving the
autograph of his four fingers, in red and white, on
the infant’s cheek, sending him reeling half-way
up the room, while the robes he wore were flung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
fluttering into the air, was a sight worthy of the
demons, and would have made for them a <i>matinée</i>.</p>

<p>Lynam was a quiet man. He heard the boys
their lessons, but never explained them. Under
him I had the Greek and Latin grammars so well
by heart, that, give me a week to look them over,
I could repeat them now! We had to say them,
year after year, but there was no teaching. When
he got rid of a class he was at once at his own
work, and that probably was “The Lives of the
Roman Emperors,” published after his decease.</p>

<p>Trollope was of the neuter gender. He must
have been paralyzed at some period of his life, for
his articulation was jumbled; he rolled one word
into another before it took sound, and he dragged
a leg after him as a Scotchman would a haddock.
But his father, the doctor, carried the divinity, in
which he had graduated, about his person. His
shovel hat, his robes, all bespoke that heavenly
dandy, a dignitary of the Church Catholic and
Apostolic. He looked worthy the order of the
black silk pinafore.</p>

<p>In those days, and long after, an English clergyman
dressed like a gentleman; he now wears a
black livery, and he looks like a bishop’s footman, in
mourning, with his master, for some dead archbishop.</p>

<p>The school was truly classical and nothing else,
except for the teaching of “spongy” Reynolds and
“hacky” Clark—the writing and arithmetic masters—the
affix of this first being due to a nose which
was amorphous and appeared to belong to the class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
<i>Porifera</i>, or sponges, while that of the second was
due to a guttural crackling sound of the man’s voice.</p>

<p>To do Reynolds justice, he was not impatient,
and he was painstaking with his pupils. To
facilitate his arithmetical instruction he wrote two
lines of verse which were <i>naïve</i>—they ran thus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Profit and loss accounts are plain;</div>
<div class="verse">We debit loss and credit gain.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But his supreme merit was that of substituting
geographical for moral texts in our copy-books.
One I remember, for small text, was, “Batavia in
Java, capital of the Dutch settlements.”</p>

<p>Reynolds was somebody. He married his
daughter to Thomas Hood, and his son was, I
believe, the Reynolds of Sunday newspaper fame.</p>

<p>With this exception the school was purely
classical; nothing whatever was taught but Greek
and Latin. History, geography, English, and its
grammar, were unheard of. We had to teach
ourselves to read and spell, and none will dispute
that the prayers before scanty meat were beautifully
given by the Grecians, those head boys who proceeded
to the University. Grammar we learnt only
from the Greek and Latin, but it was sufficient;
composition we derived from the same source,
whence, perhaps, our habit of inversion, so offensive
nowadays to poetic dribblers, who doat on Wordsworthy
prose.</p>

<p>The steward of the school, who was ruler, a sort
of president of the growing-up republic, named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Higgins, was an oldish man, grey-pated, with a
youthful slim figure, fair skin, and a straight disciplinarian
mouth. He presided at meal-time, seated
at a desk on the large daïs at the upper end of the
hall, like a modern Pontius Pilate. There he was,
to receive criminals led to judgment by the monitors,
and to flog them without mercy. He was greatly
feared and, of course, greatly hated. He reminded
one of a snake in his movements, which were rapid
and flexible. No complaint was made to him of
the boys, by beadles or monitors, but what was
believed by him; he required no proof.</p>

<p>It was a sort of Russian system; every official,
every monitor, was a spy, and the steward was the
willing knout, a creature emotional as a reptile,
servile as a dog, and as a cat cruel.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there was one extenuating circumstance—he
had a pretty daughter, with whom a
friend and school-fellow of mine was in love.</p>

<p>I have remarked on the strictly classical character
of the school; but, after all, if one learns only one
good thing well, one wishes to know others, and can
teach one’s self. Then, classics have another advantage:
Horace alone can make a gentleman. But
what is more remarkable than all the other omissions
in the school is, that the boys were never, individually,
taught a word of religion. When it is remembered
what a powerful influence the wealth of the
clergy exercises, one must pause in wonder over the
fact of religious teaching being a thing unknown.
Religious machinery was everywhere visible. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
was a grand organ in the gallery at one end of the
dining-hall, over the doorway; there was an organist,
Mr. Glen, to accompany the hymn or psalm during
the daily services before meat, consisting of a bit of
Bible and a thanksgiving, the Grecians being pro-chaplains.
There was a form of prayer read by any
boy in the wards who was handy at bed-time, and a
chapter selected at his option; but no teaching of
the Scriptures or of the Church dogmas, if we may
except the services at Christ Church on Sundays.
There may have been such an appointment as
chaplain to Christ’s Hospital; if so it was strictly
honorary, and kept a profound secret.</p>

<p>By the way, there was some religious improvement
to be derived personally through the committing
of a misdemeanour, the punishment for
which was the getting a chapter in the Bible by
heart. I profited by this myself in a curious
manner, for, being a very sensitive boy, I made
a bad reader, so, when called upon to perform the
evening service, I always read the chapter which I
knew by heart, and that so impressively and faultlessly,
that I came off with much <i>éclat</i>.</p>

<p>I can still repeat that chapter, but no other.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_12">XII.</h2>


<p>Perhaps ten thousand boys have passed through
the school since I bade farewell to its cloisters, but
I am unable to say whether the system of non-religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
teaching has been changed. Our reverend
classical masters manifested no religious tastes; it
may be due to their not having imbibed any when
they were pupils like ourselves in the school. I do
recollect Mr. Lynam, of whom I was a pupil for
several years, correcting my pronunciation of <i>Jōb</i>,
which I called <i>Jŏb</i>. If we were reading something
from Scripture before him, I have wholly forgotten
it; the occasion must have been so rare.</p>

<p>What the effect of religious ignorance may have
been on so many before and after me, it is difficult
to surmise. I have no recollection of any boy,
in after-life, becoming a bishop or a millionaire.
Nature was open to them; she is constantly carrying
on revelations, and all must begin with these before
entertaining Divine ones. The greater our acquaintance
is with natural teaching, the better we are able
to judge of religious. A well-educated scientific
man would decide a religious question in five
minutes which would take five hundred years for all
the doctors of divinity to get to the bottom of. A
large knowledge of Nature is requisite even to find a
meaning for any inspired passage, and it is doubtful
if any divine ever had training enough to understand
fully any one important passage of Holy Writ.
Those men who are recognized as having undergone
inspiration were never able to state lucidly what
they heard, but recorded it in such shape as must
for ever puzzle the brains of the priesthood. If
such men as the Herschels had been made the
vehicles of a revelation, it would have been expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to the world in such tangible language as shuts out
all dispute.</p>

<p>The advantages of knowledge derived from
observations made within the sacred precincts of
Nature is that there is always a revelation going
on, made by a silent, invisible power that we can
question without offence. But the custodes of the
holy archives greatly disapprove of such proceeding.
The Catholic forbids the perusal of Scripture; the
Protestant the perusal of Nature; and that reverend
gorilla, the agnostic, inculcates the wisdom of studying
all things and learning nothing. Surely he is
the missing link!</p>

<p>I admire the clergy as gentlemen and men of
education, but the fault is that they proceed from
the university to the Church, and drop science
and literature out of their daily life, returning to
ignorance at the same pace as they quitted it as
children. The cultivated class find it impossible to
converse with them on any profitable grounds.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_13">XIII.</h2>


<p>My mother’s youngest brother was an officer of
artillery, and, as adjutant, was always stationed at
Woolwich. He had married the daughter of a Mr.
Samuel Enderby, an oil-merchant, and a man of
great wealth, living on Croom’s Hill, Greenwich,
when first I knew his family, and afterwards moving
to a mansion on Blackheath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>When a day’s holiday occurred, I and my cousin
walked down to my uncle’s house, taking that of the
Enderbys on our way. We were paid our travelling
expenses both ways, though we never rode, but
kept the money in our pockets, together with the
heavy tips that we got at both houses.</p>

<p>My uncle did not attain the rank of captain, even,
till middle age. Promotion in the artillery, going by
rotation, was slow, and so long remained, owing to
the Duke of Wellington’s narrow ideas, and <i>brevet</i>
at last had to be substituted for real rank.</p>

<p>My uncle, however, died a lieutenant-general,
with a good-service pension, followed by the command
of a brigade.</p>

<p>My son, Alfred Egmont Hake, has given a true
and pleasing account of my uncle, Henry William
Gordon, and his family relations, derived from information
supplied by me for his “Story of Chinese
Gordon,” who was one of my uncle’s younger sons.</p>

<p>I had a strong love for this uncle, and he reciprocated
the feeling; nay, more, he always overlooked
my faults, which were not a few in the eyes
of those relatives who were incompetent to judge
me, and expected me to play the commonplace
game in life for which, unfortunately, I was wholly
unqualified.</p>

<p>Charles Gordon’s education was military only.
His rapidity of perception and combination, so conspicuous
in his command of an army, were left
otherwise barren; he was, therefore, unable to grasp
the great truths that surround our actual being,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
sacrificing their beauty and enjoyment to a meaningless
superstition. He had even humour of the most
delicate kind, without which no man of genius is
ever born, for it is the crowning faculty of man’s
intellect.</p>

<p>As possessing a judgment myself which reaches
no conclusion before passing through an unprejudiced
analysis of all things great and small concerning
it, I have never been able to conceive a
soldier’s duties accordant with a Christian’s, or to
realize such an idea as that of a man leading one
army of paid assassins against another, with a love
of Christ, or of his Maker, or of mankind in his
heart. The fact that men offer their own lives
only shows how earnest they are in the profession
of shedding blood. Those of the Mahometan class
might infuse religion into slaughter; but not one
of the disciples or evangelists could have done it,
except one.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Rich must a hero be in superstition</div>
<div class="verse">Who deems ’twas God who gave him his commission.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Throughout his childhood and youth, Charles
Gordon associated with soldiers. His family were
of the military class; he imbibed the love of their
profession. He had an acute mind, with faculties
which, if trained, would have served for a philosopher;
but he had not the originality that leads a
man to educate himself, and to cast all falsehood out
of his nature. A slight knowledge of physiology
would have sufficed to root out most of his theological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
ideas; but that slight knowledge, even, he
did not possess; and what he most wished might
be, he believed. His name is great, but his reputation
will rest finally on his military genius and his
many virtues.</p>

<p>But to return to my subject. A day’s holiday at
Woolwich was a pleasant pastime. It sometimes
included a visit to Greenwich Hospital, sometimes
a review, and more than once a sight of Richardson’s
Theatre at Greenwich Fair-time, when all that is
tragical in the world was enacted with all the rant
that tradition had handed down from stage to stage.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_14">XIV.</h2>


<p>I passed my last remaining holidays with my
mother at Exeter, the old dean and chapter town
of the west. Exeter continues in my mind to be
a mediæval city, its inhabitants a people of the
middle ages. To enjoy the height of respectability
it was necessary to have a visiting connection with
the bishop of the diocese, and this secured the
unenviable acquaintance of the dean, the Mr. Dean,
the divinest of doctors, and the whole chapter,
which, judging from its antecedents, owed its importance
to and was in itself a mere Chapter of
Accidents. To think how men, ignorant of all
things save privilege and dogma, can testimonialize
their fellow-citizens by means of a nodding smile!
To be admitted into the close to eat mutton and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
red-currant jelly with the canons of the cathedral
was a fortune of social rank, sufficiently ample to
confer honour on the dozens who knew them. How
strange is all this to minds of any magnitude! A
string of minor infallibles, each the owner of dearly
beloved brethren whom he condescends to despise,
ruling over the pauper intellects and imaginations
of a city!</p>

<p>Yet all these idolaters are great economists;
instead of earning their own respectability, they
seek to get it dirt-cheap by having it conferred
upon them.</p>

<p>I found my mother in better circumstances; her
younger uncle had died, and as he could not take
his hoard away with him, he left it to be divided
among his near relations, but the only one, the Rev.
Robert Clarke, who bore his name, came best off;
and he deserved it, not only for his own sake, but
because he was already better off than most of those
who profited under the will! This cousin was the
kindest, the most clerically gentlemanlike of the
cloth he favoured. The name of Clarke is on
record at Hexham as that of liberal Church patrons.</p>

<p>But mediæval cities and people of the middle
ages, still playing out the ancestral game, have their
theatres. To that of Exeter I went to see Yates
perform the part of Falstaff. I was deeply bitten
by the fun, and the next day performed much of
the character myself before my mother, and kept
her in a continual roar of laughter.</p>

<p>The eminent surgeon, Mr. Shelden, was, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
times preceding, a practitioner in the place; as such
he was a friend of the Gordons. He left a relict,
whom my mother often took me to see—a charming
lady, who knew how to make herself delightful to
a child. Mr. Shelden was Professor of Anatomy
at the College of Surgeons in London. In the
museum of the college there is a mummy which
he made, and which he called “Madame Mahogany.”
It excited much curiosity at one time. On visiting
the museum, I readily found it on the left of the
entrance door. There is a portrait of this eminent
man in the Devon and Exeter Hospital, painted
by the artist from memory after Shelden’s death,
and it was said to be an excellent likeness by those
who remembered him.</p>

<p>It may interest some to know that my grandfather
resided for many years at Bowhill House in
St. Thomas’s. The place was purchased over his
head, and made the county lunatic asylum, which
purpose I believe it serves to this day.</p>

<p>With this place were associated some of my
mother’s happiest as well as most miserable recollections.
The names of those who were known to
her family are still rife in the old red sandstone
country, and have been distinguished in the new
generation. I must mention that of Mr. Northmore,
of Cleve, who was a generous-minded reformer
in days when to be a radical was worse than to lead
a life of blasphemy. He was the first scientific
man who succeeded in condensing a gas. The one
he operated on was chlorine; his results were published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in <i>Nicholson’s Journal</i> in the year 1809. So
little interest attached to great discoveries in those
days that his researches were forgotten, and Faraday
long afterwards succeeded in the same work. He
had never heard the name of Northmore, and published
his own results as the first obtained in that
direction. This I learned from Mr. Northmore
himself, when I was grown up. That philosopher
did not even claim his discovery when the scientific
world was ringing with Faraday’s praise.</p>

<p>Among other friends of her youth my mother
long remembered with affection her school-fellow,
Ann Gifford, the daughter of a grocer in Exeter.
The name was afterwards known through the brother
becoming master of the rolls and obtaining a peerage
as counsel for great George our king, during
the prosecution of the queen.</p>

<p>In those days counsel were at their boldest,
when Denman, who had to examine the Duke of
York, could say to him in open court, “Stand forth,
thou slanderer!”</p>

<p>I have heard say that one of the most amusing
transfigurations ever produced, without a miracle,
was that of Mr. Wareman Gifford, from a grocer
behind the counter to the brother of a lord.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_15">XV.</h2>


<p>At school was laid the foundation of two lifelong
friendships; one with Henry Edmondes, who afterwards
was a barrister, and became deputy clerk of
the peace for Middlesex during Sergeant Adams’s
chairmanship—another with Hugh Worthington
Statham, who proceeded to medicine, finally occupying
the mastership of the Worshipful Company of
Apothecaries. Edmondes was of short stature, with
an intellect the better of which I have never known.
He had all the humour of Charles Dickens, and,
had he lived, might have proved a closer rival than
Thackeray to that inimitable writer. He had advantages
that Dickens never acquired; he was a
scholar, well read in English, French, and Italian,
as well as in classics, and was free from that silly
sentimentalism which at times placed Dickens below
par.</p>

<p>Statham, like myself, is still alive: never losing
sight of the <i>literæ humaniores</i>, he threw his excellent
abilities into the healing art, and touched the first
place in his branch of the profession. Next to my
brother, he is my oldest friend. Our first meeting
must have been seventy years ago.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>I have not yet alluded to the King’s Ward, a
sort of aristocratic section of the school, in which
the boys were trained for the navy. Candidates
were received into it at their own option. They
formed a society apart, not associating with the
other boys; consequently their deeds were traditional,
relating to how in times past they had been
in revolt, defying their masters, escaping from the
school, and, after being retaken, how they were
locked up in the prison cell and tamed on bread and
water.</p>

<p>Their studies were under a mathematical master,
apart from the other boys. They were distinguished
by a metal badge with some emblem upon it, which
was worn by them on the left shoulder.</p>

<p>They were always considered a very “gallous”
set, which, in the school vocabulary, signified
“daring.”</p>

<p>I preferred my solitary walks in the cloisters to
joining in the games, and this secluded habit sometimes
raised a faction against me, and I had only
the choice left me of yielding or of being mobbed.
There was a game in which some hundreds held on
to each other by the tails of their coats, while the
leader determined the direction they should take by
going himself the way which pleased him. I was
always a candidate for the leadership, and my plan
was to drag the long chain of boys through segments
of circles to left and back to right; the effect
of this was, by a swift and sudden turn, to throw half
the boys off their legs to the ground, the hinder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
ones coming in for the fall as the impetus given by
the foremost reached them.</p>

<p>It appears remarkable, at first thought, that with
so many hundreds one should learn the name of
every boy; but it is nothing compared with what is
achieved by study. Some forty years ago I had
a conversation with Professor Henslow, of Cambridge,
on the subject of getting names by heart.
At that time there were sixty thousand plants classified.
He said that a botanist would by degrees fix
all these names on his memory without any effort.</p>

<p>A memorable group among us was that of three
brothers named Leighton, a family of such beauty
as can only be rarely seen. Two of them were
Grecians. The eldest, James Leighton, was tall,
with dark hair and complexion, and of a graceful
figure. He proceeded to the university early in
my time, so I saw little of him, but that little has
lasted my memory for seventy years. David
Leighton came next; he was of a fair complexion,
with large grey eyes, with nose and lips exquisitely
curved, and a countenance expressive of talent and
good nature.</p>

<p>The Grecians might reach their twentieth year
at the school, and, as men, had the advantage of
their dress being made of fine cloth; it was otherwise
the same as that of the boys, except that they
had broad red girdles, stamped like those of the
monitors. In such dress the Grecians had a truly
noble appearance; one might think of them as high
officials at the court of Edward the Sixth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The youngest of the group was Frederick Leighton,
my junior, and my particular friend. He had
dark and refined features, with curling hair.</p>

<p>I met David Leighton again at Baden Baden in
1832, among the fashionable crowds from all
nations. He was chaplain to the English residents
of the place. I have heard nothing more of this
fine family from that time to this.</p>

<p>I asked him what he had done at Cambridge.
His answer was, that he had disgusted his whole
family.</p>

<p>Another contemporary, one who made some
figure in professional life, was Lawson Cape. As
a boy he was the greediest of readers. His father
brought him historical works week after week, and
he devoured their contents as fast as they reached
him. He was short, fair-haired, freckled, quick at
reading, quick at learning, quick at looking about
him. It was difficult to follow his movements, so
excited were they on all occasions. I met him
again at Florence, during the carnival. I saw him
abroad once more at Baden Baden, after which he
settled in London as an accoucheur, when I came
across him for the last time.</p>

<p>He was related to Sir Charles Locock, and
through his influence acquired an obstetric practice
in town.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> He died at the beginning of 1892, after entering his eighty-fourth
year. He was two months my senior. I have later on
made a distinction between early friends and later ones, dwelling
on the fact that what happens to us before we have attained our
full growth is nourished as a part of us, and so becomes ingrained
in our natures.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_16">XVI.</h2>


<p>Dr. Basham, physician to the Westminster
Hospital, was another of us. I lost sight of him
between the years 1824 and 1860, when I met him
in the laboratory, and knew him again at a glance.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Cole, whom I had not seen for five
and thirty years, another boy, came across me at
one of Lady Ripon’s receptions; I recognized him
too, though he was disguised in the broad red
ribbon and star of the Bath.</p>

<p>These two men reached notoriety, each in his
calling, Basham as a physician, Cole as an official
in the office of Records. But they and their like
were of the vanishing class, their names are disappearing;
they filled only a little space in their own
generation, which they accompany to oblivion.</p>

<p>My school days are a memory that I have never
refreshed by visiting those ancient halls and cloisters;
once only since I left them have I passed through
from Newgate Street to Little Britain. I found all
there was doubly dead. It was dead in its own
past, and dead in mine. I saw a moral blank in
which love was absent, absent as it had ever been
between the pupil and his masters. During my
holidays at Seaford, I experienced thirty days at a
time of love and kindness; the recollection of this
drew me to it again. I was seldom at Brighton
without going over there with my brother and his
wife, or with his children and mine, to look once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
more at the house on the Crouch, and to walk over
that beautiful south down that ascends from the
beach and the sea to Cuckmere.</p>

<p>When we no longer knew one living creature
there, we still found pleasure in asking the oldest
inhabitants if they remembered Captain and Mrs.
Wallinger.</p>

<p>When I quitted school and gave up the mediæval
costume, I was put into fine clothes, and spent a
fortnight at Woolwich, taken about from sight to
sight by my uncle, dining often at the artillery mess,
taking a spare bed at the quarters of Colonel Wylde,
and waited on by his man, when I learned, and
have since often found, that a soldier makes the
best valet in the world. Whatever familiarity you
may show him, he never becomes familiar with you;
he is always respectful. No one knew this better
than my famed cousin, Charles Gordon. He, when
at home, would talk to the soldier-footman of certain
members of his mother’s family, who were expected
as guests, and, calling them good-naturedly by
opprobrious names, would ask if they were in the
house; but the servant, however hard driven by
the persistency of his young master, would to the
last pretend not to understand to whom he made
allusion.</p>

<p>I did not like that visit to Woolwich: my uncle
was very severe, though only at the moment, on the
faults of young people, though a kinder heart could
not well be. The evenings were formal; we sat
round a table, every one in some manner occupied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Unused to fine furniture I kicked the leg of the
table. The uncle showed anger on his expressive
face, while he asked, “Can’t you reconnoitre?” I
was given an elegant copy of “Gil Bias” to read;
unused to such editions, unused to reading in the
presence of fine people, I damped my finger at my
lips. “Give me the book,” shouted the good uncle;
“I’ll show you how to turn over the leaves!” In
this he performed the feat as any other gentleman
would do, and handed the book back.</p>

<p>This and similar incidents so troubled me that I
contemplated taking flight; but my patience under
trial prevailed, and I bided the time for a visit to
Seaford, which soon came about.</p>

<p>This was in 1824, when Charles Gordon was
not yet a denizen of our world.</p>

<p>Colonel Wylde, my host at the barracks when
the family house on the common was full, played a
part which relieved him from the humdrum of
military life. He spoke Spanish fluently, and, at a
time when such a man was much wanted by the
Government, he was employed on a mission to
Spain; and afterwards, when Prince Albert became
one of our royal family, he was appointed as his
equerry, and became a great favourite at court. He
was my uncle’s closest friend; but on the command
of a brigade falling vacant, Wylde, then general,
was given the appointment, though one below my
uncle in seniority, on whom by custom it should
have devolved, and this one incident cooled the warm
friendship of a long life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Owing to his urbanity, his knowledge of life, and
his pleasant face, Wylde became a great favourite
with the royal family, the queen, the princes and
princesses, all of whom loaded him with presents.
Prince Albert pressed on him a baronetcy, which,
from a mistake in the bestowal of his early affections,
he could not accept. It was an arbitrary act of the
Duke of Cambridge to break through the rules of
the service and give him a brigade which was due
to another, to a friend; perhaps he should have
refused, but doubtless the pressure on all sides was
heavy, not to mention that Wylde had a family
which would have been large if divided between two.</p>

<p>What made this brigade business more aggravating
was, that the duke had contracted an intimacy
with my uncle and his family, and was really his
friend.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_17">XVII.</h2>


<p>Leaving Woolwich, I went on a long visit to my
relations, the Wallingers, with whom I had passed
so many happy holidays while at school.</p>

<p>Seaford occupies a line on the southern coast
most charming to the eye, but its beauty has been
its ruin. A picturesque expanse of back water
extends from its magnificent cliff to Newhaven, and
the time came when its decaying vegetation generated
typhoid fever, which destroyed the reputation
of the place, while it decimated the inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Another calamity followed: a high spring tide,
not so many years ago, washed away the houses in
front of the sea, and overflowed the streets. Repairs
have been made, new structures raised, private
houses, hotels, and a convalescent hospital; but it
is no longer the Seaford it was of old, in its rotten-borough
days.</p>

<p>I was once more there with my kind aunt, and
an uncle whose brow smiled while it frowned.
There were two branches of Wallinger; my uncle
was a cadet of the elder branch, then represented
by the Rev. John Wallinger, the disinherited heir
of Hare Hall, who went from the law to the Church
for the love of Calvin.</p>

<p>The younger branch was represented more to
one’s taste by the Rev. William Wallinger and his
brother Arnold, a sergeant-at-law. John was too
busily engaged on Calvin’s affairs to visit Seaford at
this time, but William was in a manner settled there
with his pupil, the young Lord Pelham. Other
members of the family came there to make up a
seaside season; among them the wife and daughters
of William Roberts, who was Teller of the Exchequer,
an office held by his father before him, both
renowned epicures, who held to the axiom that a
good cook was three hundred and sixty-five blessings
a year. Mrs. Roberts was a sister of the Rev. John,
and brought with her a string of seven daughters,
all less beautiful than their mother. Then the
family of Mr. Nussey, the king’s apothecary, added
to the list of visitors, he being an old friend of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Nussey was a very lovely woman. She
was the daughter of Mr. Walker, her husband’s predecessor
at court; in fact, the Walkers and Nusseys,
in turn or together, had been apothecaries to the
royal family time out of mind, and it was said that
the late Mr. Walker was the only man who knew
how to reach the vein in George the Fourth’s fat
arm.</p>

<p>Nussey, whom I knew very intimately later in
life, told me that the king confided to him all his
secrets, and that the knowledge, if written down,
would set all England in a blaze. He was with the
royal patient to the last, the king never letting go
of his hand for twenty-four hours, which gave him
an agony of cramp all but insupportable.</p>

<p>Nussey was a man deservedly esteemed; he had
that gracious manner which comes often from enjoying
the confidence of the great.</p>

<p>I must say a few words more about William
Wallinger. Any attempt to describe his countenance
would be made utterly in vain; it is in this that the
artist may assert his superiority to the writer. No
one ever saw him without surprise to find himself in
company with so much grace and manly beauty.
He was too gentlemanly for a king, too quietly self-possessed
for a noble, too impressive in manner for
any other human being but himself. He inherited
a good fortune; he might have had the pick of the
country in preferment had he so chosen, but he
refused profitable livings, among others that of
Stanmer, a village in Lord Chichester’s park, preferring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
modest pulpits and independence. He was
much thought of by the people at Hastings for a
period. There Lord Chichester had a chapel built
for him; but he often changed his residence and
varied his duties. He was attached to Tunbridge
Wells, where his sister, Mrs. Jederé Fisher, resided
at her seat called Great Culverden. She was the
widow of Mr. Jederé Fisher, of Ealing Park, Middlesex,
a charming residence, sold later on to Sir
William Lawrence, the eminent surgeon, now cut up
into streets and villas.</p>

<p>Her son is a well-known Kentish magnate.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_18">XVIII.</h2>


<p>As a rudiment of that vaulting ambition and its
consequences which grew up in me by degrees, and
has, I lament to say, remained with me, though now
grown prudent and steady, the better aims of which
I have striven to fulfil, I may mention here, in taking
leave of my boyhood, that there was a bath at
Islington called Peerless Pool, to which in summer
the boys of the school were sent to bathe. It was
a large mass of water, oblong in shape, with a wide
promenade. There we would spend a whole afternoon,
sent there by the authorities when the half-holiday
was at hand. There, to excite the wonder
and applause of the other boys, I punished myself
by taking the longest run to the water’s edge that
was obtainable within the enclosure, and leaping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
somersault fashion into the air to a great height,
and reaching the water in a seated posture. In
doing this I entailed on myself a punishment equal
to being flogged. Being somewhat sheepish at the
age of fifteen, I did not stand very high in the estimation
of my uncle, General Gordon, while staying
with him at Woolwich, when one day he took me
down to the Thames to bathe. There was a platform,
probably for the soldiers to jump from into
the water; this afforded me a long run, and I resolved
on performing my feat. My uncle was perfectly
amazed at it, and often alluded to it with surprise in
later years.</p>

<p>After this display of my pluck, he was much in
favour of my going into the army.</p>

<p>By this time my mother was gravitating southwards
with my sister and brother, that she might be
near her sisters; she accordingly took a house at
Lewes, where there was a good grammar school
suitable for my brother.</p>

<p>The process of intellectual growth in all probability
differs in individuals; what it was in me I
am able to state. It is my opinion that with the
same organism as I now have, with which I can grasp
and master any subject, not much matter what it is,
I should have made but a poor show of intellect
but for certain elements of a moral nature. The
first of these is a sense of one’s own nothingness
without knowledge; the second is a desire for even
more knowledge than most persons possess.</p>

<p>All this is emotional, but it supplies an impulse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to intellectual motor power, which, when traced out,
proves to be of a very simple kind, consisting of
impressions derived from without being reiterated
within, and inspected over and over again. Take
several brains of the same capacity: one man has
not the impulse of ambition or desire. Say to him—</p>

<p>“All the world’s a stage.” His ear takes the
words to his brain, and they are lodged there; he can
repeat them from memory of sound. Say to another—</p>

<p>“All the world’s a stage.” He will be impressed,
first by words, on receiving them, and will repeat
them mentally, and in doing so will see that he is
reiterating a pre-existing mental impression; one
which at some time he had derived through the
eye; he will see a stage with men and women on
it—the players. He will see these making “their
exits and their entrances,” and by reiterated observation
of old impressions, which run parallel, he will
observe men and women actively employed in the
world. By a like process of observing old impressions
mentally, he will not only witness the phenomena of
human life, but will undergo the appropriate emotion
even before the phenomena are realized, the emotion
leading up to the idea.</p>

<p>Now all this requires previous knowledge, without
which no extended train of thought can be
effectively carried out; whence it is that those who
are ambitious and have a desire for knowledge, will
acquire it at every expense, both of time and labour,
and will so become accustomed to keeping their
native intellect in play.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_19">XIX.</h2>


<p>I had taken leave of boyhood and entered on
the period of youth—a time when neither children
nor men were found to be suitable companions.
The three epochs in our lives are pretty equally
divided: that of childhood, owing to the feebler
action of the forces, appears to pass away very
slowly, and ending at our fifteenth or sixteenth year
seems interminable; longer than the time it takes
to advance from forty to seventy years of age, and
quite as long as to go onwards from fifteen to forty
years.</p>

<p>Of course there is an earlier and a later youth,
and it is to the first that the preceding remark chiefly
applies, the period when ignorance is not strange.</p>

<p>At this early time we do not recognize nature
otherwise than as being ourselves, or in any way
apart from us; it is later that the line of demarkation
draws itself between the inner and outer
world; and it is then that time seems to move.</p>

<p>I suppose it was owing to a species of honesty,
but I found, very tryingly, at this time, that my self-assurance
and my knowledge were in strict proportion;
I was not, in fact, presumptuous; but of
great modesty.</p>

<p>I must put to my credit a habit of not allowing
a moment of ignorance to pass by without rectifying
it by questioning either books or persons, and I
often learnt more from others than from books.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
To this day I never come across a man possessed
of special experience without questioning him as if
I were engaged in a research. Not long ago, a
gentleman who had been twenty years in the Fiji
Islands, said of me that I had extracted more
information from him respecting the people and
country in an hour’s conversation, than had been
elicited from him by all his friends put together,
during the year he had spent in London as
commissioner from the islands during the Colonial
Exhibition.</p>

<p>I trace the increase of this habit upon me to the
practice of minute diagnosis which belongs to the
physician. By its means, at all events, I accumulated
corners of knowledge, which few appeared to
possess besides myself.</p>

<p>In a country town there is often a man or two
of eminent attainments who is buried alive. It was
so at Lewes, a feeble, antiquated presentiment of
civilization in itself; but it contained Gideon Mantell,
the great geologist, who, searching Tilgate
Forest, became the discoverer of the Iguanodon,
which is now visible in the South Kensington
Museum.</p>

<p>In those days all county towns were alike in
essentials, and Lewes was not a bad typical example.
With a small population it returned two
members to Parliament, both baronets, both wearing
pigtails, both having parks within a drive. There
was Sir John Shelley of Maresfield Park, and Sir
George Shiffner of Combe Place. Great men were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
greater in those days than they are now, or will
ever be again. Sir John looked a great man. Sir
George looked only an important one.</p>

<p>Sir John was tall, slim, upright, with the look of
a diagnostic, in whose presence a horse resolved
itself into its elements. The whip in his hand told
the man. When either of these worthies appeared
in the quiet streets—and quiet they were, except on
market days—the shop-keepers were seen standing
at their doors as if they were their own customers.
The apparition of Sir John or Sir George was like
that of Hermes, when, formerly, the god visited
Athens.</p>

<p>Like everything else that is worn out, Lewes
was discontented with its lot. Not many miles
south was Seaford, a rotten borough, and, in the
distance, Old Sarum, and this was more than
the less prosperous inhabitants of Lewes could
endure. They must have reform, and it came.</p>

<p>Like many individuals, they did not know when
they were well off.</p>

<p>After having two baronets at their command,
both with pigtails, they are no longer a parliamentary
borough; even their ancient grammar school is
turned into a commercial Academy, no longer a
Plato at its head.</p>

<p>What need is there of eternal retribution when
men are everlastingly punishing themselves?</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_20">XX.</h2>


<p>Like most other county towns Lewes had many
mansions. These in olden times were the winter
residences of nobles and squires, and, at their death,
of their relicts, for the women always survived the
men. It was considered in those days that the
taste of port wine struck the highest note on
the palatal gamut, and that gout, though painful,
was a distinction. The best lives seldom exceeded
sixty-nine. The vesical and gall compartments at
that age, generally, had completed their mineralogical
collection, and death was not pleasant.</p>

<p>Many of these mansions had the charms of not
having been decorated or repaired for a hundred
years, whence they looked much the same as when
inhabited by the dowagers of bygone generations.
So sensible were some of the later occupants of
this, that they preserved them in their pristine state,
and sat in them in old armchairs till they imagined
themselves to be ancestors; and in an instance or
two donned the pigtail to complete the illusion. So
honourable was this emblem, that no tradesman,
however mean his calling, could wear it without
being spoken of as the old gentleman, and he doubtless
felt himself to be such, though he might be
serving a customer with a jar of spermaceti oil.</p>

<p>As aforesaid, Gideon Mantell was an inhabitant
of Lewes, struggling for fame by his researches
within the chalk strata, and for a livelihood by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
practice as a surgeon and apothecary, in which he
had a fair amount of success, no doubt due to his
great abilities, but in the estimation of many to the
flash of his surroundings. His gig and groom were
models as they waited at his door. His coat of
arms embraced your vision as it shone in the fan-light
and whispered of greatness within. He was
tall, graciously graceful, and flexible, a naturalist,
realizing his own lordship of the creation.</p>

<p>Mantell had a brother in his business, a man,
short and deformed, of a quiet, obliging manner.
His name was Joshua. He had a son who also
made himself heard in later times from the wilds of
New Zealand, as a successful scientific explorer.</p>

<p>Some years later the good Earl of Egremont,
lord of Petworth Castle, great in his generosity,
presented Mantell with a large sum of money to
start him in a spacious mansion at Brighton, where
he might set up his fine museum, and pursue his
profession in a wider field. Removing to this from
Lewes he still pursued his science, but the sort of
ground he needed was preoccupied, and, disposing
of his collection to the trustees of the British
Museum, he migrated finally to a suburb of London,
I think it was to Clapham.</p>

<p>Had Government allowed such a man as Mantell
a thousand a year for the purposes of science, he
would have brought the geology of his day to perfection!
How creditably they might have amended
the sacrifice by withholding the £70,000 from the
British Gallery for the purchase of a sham Raphael,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and a preposterous Rembrandt, which the pencils of
those artists never touched—an invalid housemaid
on a throne as Virgin, and a Charles the King on a
cart-horse! Raphael painted only beauty, Rembrandt
only grace. But the English are the meanest judges
of art in Europe. An Italian picture-dealer would
have set them right in a few minutes.</p>

<p>What have the trustees done with those fabulous
Correggios, which once made such a figure and
were shelved to the entrance passage, when the
National Gallery was still in Mr. Angerstein’s
mansion in Pall Mall?</p>

<p>There were other worthies in this town of Lewes:
Mr. Horsfield, author of the “History and Antiquities
of Lewes;” Mr. Lower, a stationer, who wrote on
Sussex worthies; and the master of the Grammar
School, Dr. Proctor, whose voice crackled emphasis
and accent. He was one of the rolling stones that
gather no moss; Lewes failed him and he took a
mansion towards Kemp town; he was tempted from
his school there to Jersey, and became Principal of
its College, but this did not fit him for any length
of time. My brother, who was his pupil, met him
now and then in after days in the streets of London;
he was then always on his way to see the bishop.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_21">XXI.</h2>


<p>All this time I was a student of medical science
under a truly eminent man, Thomas Hodson, the
highest authority in his profession within the bounds
of Sussex. His career and station gave him every
claim to be classed with the worthies of his age.
He was the friend and fellow-student of Astley
Cooper, and the other aristocrats of surgical art.
All acknowledged him as their equals, though his
skill and abilities were in a measure hidden from
the admiration of the world. He was numbered
among the leading lithotomists, having extracted the
stone by means of the greatest operation in surgery,
somewhere about a hundred times, with unvarying
success.</p>

<p>It was in reflecting on the skill of such men that
I always regarded surgery as a science far above all
that physic can attain to.</p>

<p>Thomas Hodson is a name not to be forgotten.
He loved his art passionately, and he would discourse
on it with all the fervour it deserved. It is an art;
but look at its foundation! The human frame is a
transparency to the surgeon’s eyes. He is never in
the dark, but sees his way clearly, with a perfect
knowledge of what has to be done from first to last.
It is otherwise with physic: the physician can fulfil
certain indications, with certain remedies; these very
few in number. For the rest, how these operate,
what work they perform in modifying function he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
can never fully foresee. Nor will science ever reach
such a pitch as to enable him to trace the changes
which occur in the system, under the influence of a
single dose.</p>

<p>He can swim, but he is mostly out of his depth,
and that too often in troubled waters.</p>

<p>On the other hand, physicians generally used
to receive a better education than surgeons; such
of them as respect their position, make themselves
acquainted with every branch of knowledge, whether
in literature, science, or art; in social life all doubtful
questions, when all others are at a loss, are
referred to them; and it is fully expected of them
that they will have a ready reply.</p>

<p>Hodson was one of the most amiable men I ever
knew, and his manners were sweet and elegant to
such a degree as to make it deserving of mention
that on being thwarted he became the most passionate
of men. The world, then, seemed hardly large
enough to hold him. Such a trifle as the loss of a
letter, or of a book, would set him off. Smiling,
pale with anger, he would exclaim, “Will you look
about for me?” Then, rapping on the table with
his bent forefinger, forcibly enough to crack the
mahogany, he would shout, “I have looked high,
I have looked low; I have looked uphill, I have
looked downhill, and I have looked on level ground.
Help me for my sake; if you won’t do so for my
sake, help me for God’s sake; and if you won’t help
me for God’s sake, do so for Jesus Christ’s sake;
for they say he was a good ⸺!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Hodson was a man of middle stature, fair,
although old; bald, with a finely shaped head, and
silvery hair; with classic features, and a most
intelligent expression. His manner was courteous
and, in its particular fashion, graceful. It is no
wonder that such a man, gifted as he was, should
have been the delight of the neighbouring gentry,
and of the greater men of the town. When summoned
to Glynde or Firle, the residences of Lords
Hampden and Gage, he was always a desired
guest at the table of those nobles; and no more
genial and amusing one was anywhere to be
found.</p>

<p>Glynde, the inheritance of the late Speaker, Lord
Hampden by creation, sad to say at this hour dead,
a descendant of the great patriot, is the most
charming house, perhaps, of any in the south. A
large Elizabethan mansion, a pleasant park, downs
covered with the choicest breed of sheep in the
known world, was even made more celebrated by
the tenant farmer John Ellman, than by the lords
of the soil.</p>

<p>In those times there was such a thing as south-down
mutton!</p>

<p>John Ellman, of Glynde, was a man known to
the whole agricultural world. To those who never
saw him, he was known by his full-length portrait,
as was Coke of Norfolk, and other celebrities of his
day, to be seen in the window of a corner shop,
between St. James’s Street and Pall Mall, kept
by a gentleman who had the aspect of George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the Fourth, and was supposed to be a son of the
monarch; giving one a good idea of what the
king would have been, had he been born a
commoner.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_22">XXII.</h2>


<p>Ellman, of Glynde, was a knee-breeches man,
with top-boots, tall, coated for horseback, and
with a characteristic farmer’s hat, not scanty of brim.
As such I remember him; but when alone, or even
speaking to another, there seemed something wanting
to him, and this was a—Cattle Show.</p>

<p>I recollect his daughter—an extremely pretty
girl, sixty-five years ago. I used to wonder how
such a delicacy could come of so purely masculine
a breed of men.</p>

<p>The south-down sheep is no doubt fully kept on
at Glynde; the late Earl of Chichester, too, is said
to have kept up the breed, but it is to be feared that
it is less profitable than the fat, or wool-growing
sorts, which yield the worst mutton to the market,
and the best wool; matured for the butcher within
a year.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Sic transit gloria brebis.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Hodson took me with him to the funeral of
the then last Lord Hampden, who only enjoyed his
estate for twelve months. I entered the vault; the
crimson velvet and gilt nails were as fresh on the
coffin of the previous lord as on the one now placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
by its side. All the other red velvet coffins had
gone brown.</p>

<p>A gentleman, it was Mr. Cumberland, of the
mint, who was related to Lord Hampden, and used
to stay with him at the old family seat in Buckinghamshire,
told me that there was always a table in
the family pew on Sunday morning, with wine
glasses on it, and a bottle of port wine, with which
the friends regaled themselves during the weary
service at church, which, as a duty, they attended,
so setting a good example to the village folk.</p>

<p>It is a useless fashion to bury the dead in red
velvet, as a finish off to the oak, and the leaden
coffins. However, all this cost is met out of the
pockets of the dead, who can no longer manage
their own affairs, and have all the appearance of
bearing it with patient submission, whatever their
last wish might be!</p>

<p>Lewes stands on a spur of the downs, the river
Ouse runs at its base. Between this and the ascent,
School Hill, a turning to the left leads to an adjoining
village, Southover, deserving of mention, as
once the seat of a monastery of historic interest.
There, too, is what was Mr. Newton’s residence, the
Priory, a fine old Gothic structure, that is to say,
if it still is there.</p>

<p>In the parish of St. Anns, there are the remains
of a castle, worthy the attention only of antiquarians,
and thence the road leads on to Brighton,
a journey of eight miles; but all this is sixty-five
or sixty-six years ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>My uncle and aunt, Captain and Mrs. Wallinger,
at this time left Seaford and settled at Southover,
where Mrs. Gwynne, having become a widow,
settled likewise. So there were three weird sisters
who had never lived in the same place since their
marriage, once more grouped together.</p>

<p>I had acquired some anatomical knowledge, Mr.
Hodson having recently purchased a new skeleton,
a very gentlemanly one, which gave one the idea
of its having been in very good society. I had
induced it to yield me a very substantial knowledge
of its bones.</p>

<p>I had also fully mastered the “Pharmacopœia
Collegii Regalis Medicorum Londinensis,” not only
the last but some preceding issues of the work. I
knew all the drugs, and the tinctures, and the
spirits; so I was in some measure prepared to
study disease, and learn the uses of medicines.
This was in 1827, when I entered myself at St.
George’s Hospital, and took a room at 191, Sloane
Street, over a hair-dresser’s shop. The name of
my landlord was Bloxup; of my landlady, Jones;
from which it may be inferred that it was Bloxup
and Co., Limited.</p>

<p>I have noticed that happy couples who marry
themselves to each other often lead a more decent
life than those who take the pledge. I never
lodged with a better conducted couple than the
Bloxup-Joneses. Mrs. Jones had all the ready ways
of handling fronts for lady-customers, while Mr.
Bloxup attended to the hair-crop in a room behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Thomas Young, the illustrious inventor of
the Undulatory Theory of Light, was then a
physician at St. George’s. I used to go round the
wards with him. He was thought to be very undecided
in his opinions of a case; the fact is,
medicine is so uncertain a science, it was not good
enough for such an intellect as his to work on.
Pupils learnt very little by going round with the
physicians; they heard nothing from them, and it
was regarded as a somewhat daring venture to put
a question. The best plan was to go round with
the house-physician early in the day; he would
explain to the pupils the nature of the cases and
what was being done for their cure. A friend of
mine told me that he asked Dr. Warren, while
going the round of the wards, what was the name
of a skin-disease for which he was prescribing; and
that the doctor looked at him blandly, and replied,
“I am sure I don’t know, do you?”</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_23">XXIII.</h2>


<p>In those palmy days the physicians formed a
very aristocratic class as constituting the gentlemanly
branch of the profession. Halford, Warren,
Chambers, and their compeers, were dictators.
When out of town they left a list of names in the
order in which another should be sent for in their
absence when any patient summoned them, not
knowing they were away. They began practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
with a house and a carriage, prepared to spend ten
thousand pounds, and wait; having nothing to do,
except to dance attendance at the hospital from
year to year, until their turn came round for election.
They never wrote a book, that would have been
to give their knowledge away, whereas, what they
wanted was, to be paid. The public at that time
was fully of opinion that a man who wrote had
nothing else to do. Their turn came as soon as
could be expected. Among these tide-waiters some
were left fortunes and retired, while some were
worn out and gave up the contest.</p>

<p>These men were often fellows of their college,
always from Oxford or Cambridge; a degree from
either qualified them to become fellows of the
college of physicians, while all others were only
licentiates.</p>

<p>The revolution came, and all this was overthrown.
The young and active physicians reported
cases, and advertised their abilities by writing
books. To crown all, the queen succeeded to the
throne, and Dr. James Clark, her physician, only
a licentiate of the college, had all the royal appointments
of the profession placed in his hands! With
this, nepotism was at an end. It may be boasted
that free-trade in physic came before free-trade in
corn, and from that time medical science began to
flourish in this country.</p>

<p>There was no medical school at St. George’s;
the anatomical students went to Great Windmill
Street, where Mr. Cæsar Hawkins lectured and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
taught. The chemical students went to the Royal
Institution in Albemarle Street, where Faraday and
Brand were professors. The lectures there were
delivered at eight in the morning; beautiful and
perfect they were; the attendance was very thin.
I am proud to remember that I imbibed my first
ideas of chemistry at such a fountain head. Faraday
was most charming, most unpretending; his experiments
never failed, nor did those of his colleague,
who was a model lecturer; gentlemanly, perfect of
expression, exact of execution.</p>

<p>While attending the prescribed courses, I went
often to hear the eminent lecturers of the various
schools. Sir Astley Cooper was the popular man,
but neither he, with his noble figure, nor Green,
with his oratory, approached Abernethy, who was
by nature a perfect master of the comic.</p>

<p>There was an unassumed drollery and archness
in his way of looking up with his head bent down,
in the absence of a smile, nay in the solemnity of
his face, while he narrated cases in all the humour
of circumstance and situation. It was his own
unstudied manner, and great would the actor have
been who could have imitated it.</p>

<p>Mr. Abernethy found his match in a friend of
mine, Sir David Scott, then a young baronet just
beginning to enjoy his position in life. Visiting the
great surgeon, he was received with the usual
contempt that was bestowed on patients by him,
who remarked, “I suppose you are an idle man
about town, perhaps an officer in the Guards?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
He asked a few questions, prescribed and told
the patient, as usual, to read his book. Sir David
rose and depositing the fee, crumpled up the prescription
and flung it in the air.</p>

<p>“Why do you do that?” asked Abernethy.</p>

<p>“Because,” answered Scott, “you have not gone
into my case.”</p>

<p>On this Abernethy called him back, investigated
his complaint carefully, and gave him a fresh prescription,
saying, “Excuse me, but I cannot tell you
with what nonsense I have to bear from the fools
who come here for my advice!”</p>

<p>I heard this from Sir David, one of my earliest
friends, whom I shall have occasion to speak of
at large.</p>

<p>It was now that my uncle, Captain Wallinger,
died, and the four sisters were all widows. Close
upon this the great event in their family happened;
the death of the uncle, William Clarke, who left
considerable wealth which was divided among his
nephews and nieces, of which my mother was one.</p>

<p>William Clarke reached the age of 95; he was
well known in the city, but he had no calling except
that of belonging to the Mercers’ Company in whose
grounds in Cheapside he rests.</p>

<p>My mother, with my brother and sister, came to
town and we settled in a house in Chapel Street,
Grosvenor Place, at which time Belgrave Square
was in the course of being built. Grosvenor Place
was at that period a picturesque row of brick-built
houses, which have since been replaced by others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of a more stately kind. No. 1 was Tattersall’s,
approached by an archway at the side of the front
door, the house being occupied by Mr. Lane, who
had been house-surgeon at St. George’s, next door.
The hospital itself was of old brick, but occupied
its present large area with one entrance in Grosvenor
Place and another at Hyde Park Corner.</p>

<p>The Iron Duke’s house opposite, which was the
said corner, was of as dingy a brick as the hospital.
His good taste encased it in stone on his own
account, and employed the architect, Mr. Burton,
to erect the fine entrance to the park adjoining
on account of the Government.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_24">XXIV.</h2>


<p>I was in London more or less until I reached my
21st year (1830); by that time the hospital and its
teachers had gone stale, when the idea occurred to
me to visit the Scotch Universities. I took my way
to Edinburgh by steamer, and very pleasant the
voyage was. There were pretty young ladies on
board, who soon became as friendly as if they had
been relations. But not to be forgotten was a
gentleman who had wit and vivacity; I remember
his name quite well. He told me that he was
crossing to get out of the way of his creditors for
a little time, and to visit his kinsfolk. He looked
to me about 45 years old, when he told me, as
a sort of joke, that he was a classical tutor in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
London and had been spending too much money,
adding, with self-apologetic glee, “You see what it is
to be a young fellow!” I did not know at the moment
that he had been spending five pounds of mine,
nevertheless such proved to be the case before we
parted, for that was the trifle he—“by-the-bye”—wanted
of me for a few days, his days very much
resembling the six notable ones during which the
world was created. He took me to Ambrose’s
Hotel, a very comfortable one, the scene of Wilson’s
drunken <i>Noctes Ambrosianæ</i>, and we had a double-bedded
room. I was in bed first and it was left
to him to extinguish the light, which he did by
blowing it out. It was a candle of tallow, and,
to my disgust, the stench of it soon filled the room.
I protested vehemently against his proceeding, when
his reply was, “You don’t know now what you may
get to like in time!”</p>

<p>I acquired the friendly acquaintance, at Edinburgh,
of Dr. Greville, the eminent author of a
work on the <i>Cryptogamia</i>; he was married to an
Eden, the sister of Mrs. Northmore of Cleve, whose
husband I have already spoken of, a noble old
Devonshire squire.</p>

<p>Dr. Robert Knox was in his glory in those days,
the greatest anatomist of the time, whose splendid
intellect, in opposition to Lyell and the rest, foresaw
that we had only to abide scientific progress to
discover that man belonged to an early period
of time.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I never saw Dr. Knox; he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
an enthusiast in his devotion to anatomical science;
it was his calling and his hobby in one. A dentist
once remarked to me that every man should have
a hobby besides his profession, and smilingly
admitted that his was “making money.” I have
observed that surgery has engaged many enthusiasts
in its pursuit—anatomy and pathology may be
added; but I do not remember a physician of whom
this could be so flatteringly said, unless it were
Sydenham, a true devotée. But formerly the
practice of medicine was in the dark: not altogether
so now, since the introduction of physical and
chemical diagnosis, the work of Laenec and Bright.
It is no want of enthusiasm in character itself;
it is not so very long since all the science of the
country was carried out and sustained by physicians.</p>

<p>At Aberdeen I enriched myself with the acquaintance
of Principal Jack, who showed me many
attentions—not the least of which was that of introducing
me to his charming wife and daughter.
Our acquaintance did not then cease, but continued
for some years.</p>

<p>I visited St. Andrews. What distressed me
there, was to see a large college building without
windows or roof, announcing itself to be a ruin.
It is true the university is very old, but a seat of
learning ought to last for ever, and not be allowed
to become a mere memorial of some intellectual
famine.</p>

<p>I then went to Glasgow, where Dr. Hooker was
the professor of botany in the university, and where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Dr. Badham—a scholarly gentleman—was the professor
of physic, an appointment which, as I understood,
was in the gift of the London College of
Physicians. Except Dr. Thompson, who had the
chair of chemistry, the other professors were of no
account.</p>

<p>The college, a double quadrangle, stood in the
middle of the town, where it was established by an
edict of the Pope in one of the middle ages. It was
a quaint old building, a credit to the learning of the
city: the present building being more a credit to its
wealth. The ancient structure, I presume, was
pulled down and the site disposed of.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_25">XXV.</h2>


<p>The manager of the Glasgow theatre was one
Alexander, a long-legged, long-armed Scotchman
of great mobility. He pleased the public, so I
suppose he had a fairly good troupe of actors.
However that may be, he had Edmund Kean with
him for two nights, once as Richard III., once as
Macbeth. I was deeply impressed by the acting of
this great tragedian, though I believe he was on his
last legs. It was said that he was dosed with
brandy every time he went on the stage, and that
on quitting it he sank exhausted into another’s
arms; yet, once on the boards, he was firm of step
and voice. Knowing his condition, the pathos of
the scene was the more touching, though no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
could have judged that he was a sick, much less
a dying man. His voice now clear, soft, touching;
then stentorian and explosive in its rattle, according
to the necessity of the situation.</p>

<p>With what an eye he gazed! And his demeanour!
He could bring more tragic feeling out of stillness,
and the silence of deep thought, than was to be
found in the play he performed in. It was as if the
persons he represented had escaped the grave and
thrown themselves once more into the struggle.</p>

<p>At an advanced period of the summer, my
brother came to Glasgow, and very wisely proposed
that we should make a tour; and this we did
principally on foot. We visited some of the lochs
and bens, climbed Grampian hills, and worked our
way to Breadalbane Castle, returning by Loch Long.
This I mention merely to note an incident connected
with it which was, that by the action of the fresh
air, the exercise, and the scenery on mind and body,
I imagined my emotions had a poetic cast, and
accordingly I composed verses. These my brother,
who was as little experienced in human affairs as
myself, though he was deep in the study of law,
proposed my sending to Sir Walter Scott, the all-powerful
author, soliciting his perusal, with the hope
of being taken heed of as a poet. What led to this
folly on our part was, the facility with which Crabbe
rose to fame and fortune by a similar act of impertinence.
All know that he sent some verses to the
generous Burke, which were very fresh, asking for
the patronage of that great statesman, to whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
was utterly unknown. Burke, wonderful to relate,
took him under his notice, and finally procured him
a living in the gift of the Duke of Rutland. This
was very noble of Burke, but it did a great deal of
harm by leading innocent young authors, like
myself, to suppose that the nobility and other powerful
men were still the patrons of literary men,
especially of the useless poets. If one looks back,
one perceives that the majority of our poetic authors
owed their success to patrons who made their works
a fashion. Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, had noble
or royal patrons; Milton there was no one to
patronize, whence the market value of “Paradise
Lost” rose only to ten pounds. Dryden belonged
to the upper class, so he had a patron in himself;
Pope was made a fashion through patronization:
Bolingbroke alone would have sufficed to lift him
up into fame.</p>

<p>In modern times poetry became noble itself.
There was Byron, a peer; Shelley was a sprig of
baronetcy, and a rebel in Church and State, which
was a great assistance; while Keats, being a vulgarian,
was left out in the cold to die for want of
flattery and flannel.</p>

<p>Coleridge never met with a patron; he who
surpassed every poet but one in genius; so he
famished, exclaiming, “Work without hope, draws
nectar in a sieve!”</p>

<p>And Wordsworth, with his narrow intellect and
wide emotions,—he had patrons; the cloth took
him up, and the public followed suit, an act they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
could only have performed for a third-rate poet,
the first and second-rate being much above their
comprehension.</p>

<p>The course of such human events will not have
the slightest influence on men endowed with true
poetic genius. They know the wording of their
commission; they know its signature, written as it
is in invisible ink; they know its seal, on which the
six days of creative work is engraved, with Some
One resting on the seventh.</p>

<p>The upshot of all this is, a poet is born to
celebrate Nature, who is everlasting. He informs
himself that nations fulfil only a given series of
events, and that all concerning them, except their
history and literature, is lost. He makes himself
acquainted with the bulky circumstance that Greece
and Rome were once as lively and self-confident
as ourselves, as frivolous and as fashionable, but
that in the midst of their greatness and their rubbish
there were predestined poets; that Homer was one
and Horace another, and that the legacy of their
work is the only legacy they could leave us. He
tells himself that he is appointed to do certain
work that shall hereafter celebrate the existence of
his own beloved and glorious land, the country, the
beloved country of his birth and death!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_26">XXVI.</h2>


<p>We found ourselves in the park at Breadalbane,
where there was no living being in sight. The
handsome castle stood silent and solitary, as if it
had been erected for its own accommodation. It
was a large, elegant, white structure, but had an
architectural expression not sufficiently imposing to
contend with the bold scenery around. There was
the river, making a rush for Loch Long; there were
the mountains;—these were masters of the situation
and of the castle, which seemed more like a looker-on.</p>

<p>This was my impression then; it might not be
so now.</p>

<p>We had passed the night in the cottage of a
shepherd which we entered, and we asked the gudewife
to give us food and lodging; this she did,
adding to them a hearty welcome, uncertificated as
we were. She gave us of what she had—a good
mess of porridge and milk, with oat cakes as a
second course, for porridge makes one hungry, as
we found the next morning and the next day. We
slept in beds built into recesses. On the morrow,
after our breakfast, we asked the hostess what we
were in her debt; but she scouted the idea of any
payment, so we adopted the alternative of guessing
our hotel-bill, and paying it by placing a few shillings
on the table.</p>

<p>We proceeded for some hours along Loch Long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and by noon found hunger growing upon us to a
ravenous degree. There were no habitations, much
less shops, on the way, till at length we saw a villa.
A maid-servant stood at the door with her broom.
I approached her, saying we were very hungry, and
asked her to sell us a loaf. She received my petition
with contempt, entered the villa and unsympathetically
added the slam of the door to her refusal.
To be treated as the tramps which we were, was
a new sensation.</p>

<p>That evening we ceased to be footpads, and
reached home.</p>

<p>At the end of summer, which was near, my
brother returned southwards, while I remained
through the winter session to obtain more chemistry
and to complete my study of natural philosophy and
physics. In the spring, having completed my twenty-second
year and passed the last six ones in the
study of the sciences, I thought it a good opportunity
to graduate on the spot, which I did accordingly,
and was highly complimented on my anatomical
examination by that delightful gentleman, Dr. Badham.
I had answers to all his questions on the tip
of my tongue. I may mention that I had acquired
anatomy at the then University of London, under
Granville Sharpe Pattison, at the first opening of
that great institution.</p>

<p>The Scotch character is of a very mixed kind,
perhaps too well known to need comment. It is
thrifty and extravagant, dissipated and religious,
sober and drunken, generous and mean in more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
striking contrast than that of the English people,
because it runs into greater extremes, the opposite
qualities being often united in the same individual.
I met with an instance in which even a decent respect
for death was wanting. A physician told me
he had just left a dying patient who said to him,
while breathing gutturally, “I say, doctor, isn’t this
the death-rattle?” The doctor answered, “No,
my dear sir, it is not that quite yet.” To which the
rejoinder was, “Well, if it isn’t, it is damned
like it!”</p>

<p>A Scotchman whom I met before long at Florence—he
had been one of George the Fourth’s
physicians—told me, not with a view to his credit,
that he was whistling as he entered a notorious
den in Edinburgh on one Sunday morning, when
the landlady, to use a mild term, accosted him with
the words: “Dr. B⸺, I won’t have any whustling
in my house on the sabbath day!”</p>

<p>I have twice been in Scotland since; a country
one never tires of unless one is a native.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_27">XXVII.</h2>


<p>While my eighty-fourth year has commenced I
look back over more than sixty years to the time
when studies had ceased to be obligatory. I then
took a survey of my stock of knowledge: it was
small, but it embraced the rudiments of all that was
necessary to progress. A classical education gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
me access to the ancients, but I wanted French,
which was the key to modern science. This determined
me to pass some time on the Continent, and
to get acquainted with other literatures than our
own, as well as with other manners and customs.</p>

<p>I returned to London by stage; it was in the
cold of the spring season. Two things only left a
permanent impression on my mind of that journey.
One is that I travelled with Mr. Orby Hunter, and
that we were the only two inside passengers on the
route. He was a neighbour of my mother; she,
after a long visit to her beloved and hated Exeter
had grown sick of it and of every one there, and
had gone back to town, taking up her residence with
my sister and brother in a small house, No. 49,
Grosvenor Place.</p>

<p>Mr. Orby Hunter, a great politician of the day,
was a gentleman of high caste, which made all he
said the more impressive. He was greatly disturbed
at the course events were taking. It was the eve of
a general election, and a reform bill was hanging in
the balance of parties.</p>

<p>From Mr. Orby Hunter I learnt much of the
state of feeling in the country, the resolute fight
against Peel, Wellington, and the Tories, conducted
by Grey and John Russell.</p>

<p>I did not remain long in town, but soon made
my way to Italy, remaining the best part of a year
at Florence, visiting Paris, Geneva, Milan, and
other cities on my way there and back. I shall not
give an account of my journey, but only my experiences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of it, such as having learned what coffee was
for the first time in my life, and what <i>fricandeau de
veau lardé</i> meant, at Calais. As to the latter, I have
not tasted the equal of it since. In those days there
was not a railroad on the Continent, and one travelled
by diligence, vetturino, or post.</p>

<p>My sensations were new as I trod on the pavement
of Paris for the first time. I felt myself
somewhat great, and I entered a glover’s shop and
bought an elegant pair of gloves to add to my
delusion.</p>

<p>I stayed at Meurice’s hotel in the Rue Rivoli.
There I got acquainted with Colonel de Courcy, to
whom I had a letter of introduction in my portmanteau
for Florence, not knowing it then, but there
are persons who can make friends with each other
without the assistance of a third party. Colonel de
Courcy was one of the few extremely charming men
that one meets with in the course of a long life, by
which I mean gay, amusing, good-natured, gentlemanlike,
free from reserve; men who after a few
minutes you seem to have known always and would
wish to go on knowing to the end.</p>

<p>The late Earl of Albemarle was such a man; I
refer to him later in these pages.</p>

<p>Colonel de Courcy was the brother of Lord
Kinsale, whose patent of nobility was over seven
hundred years old, the most ancient in the Dublin
College of Arms. George IV., on hearing about it,
greatly desired to see the treasured document, but
so precious was it that the heralds would only entrust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
it to certain commissioners, who were not allowed to
part with it for an hour.</p>

<p>The colonel was on his way to England, but
lingered at Paris for his pleasure, the invitation to
which also detained me, in the company of my new
acquaintance.</p>

<p>Leaving Paris in a dreadful diligence by way of
Dijon and the golden grapes, I traversed the Jura
range and entered Geneva. I stayed there too, for
of course I had to set myself up in a musical box
that played the “Parisienne” and the “Marseillaise,”
as well as in a watch and chain, besides looking at
Mont Blanc and sailing on the lake to see where the
Rhone rushed in, and to visit Lausanne in memory
of Gibbon. Nor did I fail to see the prison of
Chillon in compliment to the poet Byron.</p>

<p>My jeweller at Geneva was a very earnest
mechanic. He had studied the art of watchmaking
in London and in Paris, he had made a chronometer
to compete for some great prize and had failed, entirely
to his own satisfaction, assuring himself that
his work was of the best, but that it was impossible
to make allowance for the wear and tear of the sun!</p>

<p>The journey from Geneva to the Simplon I
found very romantic. The valley, in which lies
Martigny, was marked by driftways that looked like
roads excavated from solid snow, cut out from the
heights to the level, and which, never traversed by
travellers, appeared to lead to lands unknown.</p>

<p>At Martigny there had been a deluge, by which
every house was dislocated with the exception of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
church. The flood was caused by the bursting of a
mountain lake; the clever priests, foreseeing what
would one day happen, so constructed the church,
with a prow towards the threatening lake, as to
enable it to resist a torrent.</p>

<p>I passed over the Simplon; I saw the Borromean
Islands on the other side, and, proceeding to Milan,
paid their old owner, the great cardinal, a visit in
the cathedral. He was lying, as so many have beheld
him, in his comfortable coffin.</p>

<p>Milan even then was a most elegant city, and
most tastefully paved. I was so fortunate as to have
a letter from Sir James Clark to Dr. Ciceri, who
showed me everything, and there is no guide like a
native one; but I say now that all I care for in the
Lombard capital is the fresco of Leonardo da Vinci.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_28">XXVIII.</h2>


<p>When a man begins to write and finds he can
hardly spell his name, he looks at Bolingbroke for
style, or at Goldsmith, and gets help from both; but
woe to him if he falls in love with such rickety writers
as were De Quincy, or Carlyle! Both had bandy
pens. As a man gets older, if he has anything to
say, he is contented with being himself, and covering
his thoughts with words that exactly fit them, as the
skin fits a race-horse. An affected style betrays an
affected character, with its self-respect in abeyance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
He finds that some long words contain his idea
ready made, but he does better to shun them, and
express it in his own way, and this I have done in
writing these my memoirs.</p>

<p>Whatever my style was before visiting Italy, I
cannot now say; probably the word did not then
apply. I think that a man who is an agreeable
companion should write as he would talk to himself;
by such means only can he be what is called a
stylist.</p>

<p>Macaulay wrote as he would have preached, had
he been a parson; but, as a layman, he used stilts
for a pulpit.</p>

<p>Thackeray spent a good deal of his time on stilts.
He wrote, too, as he talked; but, then, he was a very
disagreeable companion to those who did not want
to boast that they knew him. In his society people
had to do two things when one would have been
quite enough; they had to smile titteringly as well as
to listen.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reason why no author has hitherto
described a perfect gentleman is, that it would require
his being one himself; and some people think that
no perfect gentleman ever lived except—not irreverently
speaking—the Christian founder. Richardson’s
Sir Charles was a muff, Bulwer’s Pelham a
prig, Thackeray’s Major a fop, Dickens’s Mr. Dean
an unfinished portrait.</p>

<p>Was the true gentleman ever meant to be? The
only one accredited with that character—the only
Lord—was not unacquainted with the use of irony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
even with invective itself which served his end, and
that with far greater effect than remonstrance.</p>

<p>I conceive the gentleman, like genius itself, to
be fragmentary. How men differ in their conception
of the character!</p>

<p>A lady whom I knew at one time very intimately,
conceiving that her husband was on his death-bed,
asked him to have his sons before him, and to give
them some good advice before he died. The husband
readily consented. “My sons,” he said, “your dear
mother wishes me to say a few words that may be
of benefit to you when I am gone, and I am most
anxious to acquiesce in her desire. If there is
anything that I can advise to your advantage, it
would be this: never to repel the advances of
women; it is not gentlemanly.”</p>

<p>But a perfect lady—has such a thing ever been?
Who has described it?</p>

<p>No one; it is indescribable!</p>

<p>But even the temporary gentleman has a great
charm; it is based on a model which may last for
an hour, even a day; and then crumble. Amiability
goes a long way in constructing this model; it is so
conciliating, and sometimes so gentle, that it seems
to purr. Henry VIII. no doubt handed Woburn
Abbey over to Lord John’s ancestor in a most
gentlemanly style; yet, what a wild beast he was;
his mouth was always daubed with human blood.</p>

<p>It was amiable of Lord John to bring in the first
Reform Bill, because one of its effects will ultimately
be to make Henry-Eighths of the people, who will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
re-confiscate all the Woburns in the land, and all
the Convent Gardens.</p>

<p>I was on intimate terms with a man who was
private secretary to Lord John, and who obtained
a baronetcy of him. That appreciative individual
told me that no one knew, really, what a kind,
amiable, and gentlemanly man the Lord John
Russell was. No one knew it! Did he imply that
he was himself no one?</p>

<p>But, happily for us, we have still George IV. left
us as a study.</p>

<p>Is it true that the women are to have the franchise—will
it come true? Is it true that they are to
have cushions in the Houses of Commons and of
Lords, because they are fitted for the highest offices
of State;—will it come true? If so, it is to be hoped
that the perfect lady will be evolved; one who even,
for purposes of policy, will not exercise her charms;
such a one might be trusted, because, in negotiating
with a foreign plenipotentiary she would not use her
eyes.</p>

<p>Until that happy evolution is achieved, one might
certainly appoint ugly women; they would be obliged
to rely on their intellectual gifts alone.</p>

<p>A woman’s style of speaking in private is often
very pleasant; less so in public, unless she is a
Siddons.</p>

<p>Everything will happen in turn, and awkward
things will even come about. The Press might have
to hint that Lady Mary, our minister for foreign
affairs, has been much talked about of late, as giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
too frequent interviews to the Home Secretary, Mr.
Tristram Shandy; that it is even insinuated, at
present only in private circles, that the husband of
the right honourable lady contemplates taking law
proceedings. This would prove a heavy blow to
petticoat government: it would inevitably lead to
the breaking up of the administration.</p>

<p>Thus demeanour has its peculiar style, as well
as writing.</p>

<p>Women are often great stylists; they have the
merit of writing as they would talk. Every one
knows when a book is written by a woman; she is
so good at drapery, still more at male beauty.</p>

<p>There are two styles of writing derived from
anatomy—the nervous, and muscular. Trelawny,
about whom I would say something, for his book
has come out afresh, had both of these in one—he
made them dramatic and pictorial.</p>

<p>Women are the best mistresses of the nervous
style; they supply its instances at first hand, from
flirting to hysterics; while men, like Borrow and
Trelawney, are masters of the muscular style.</p>

<p>I could give a valuable hint to writers who
would be effective, exact, and pleasing; let them
master the methods followed in the scientific style,
as in an article on “Light,” by Herschel in the
“Encyclopædia Metropolitana.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_29">XXIX.</h2>


<p>Before I went to Italy I could not write; after
I had crossed the Simplon I could: the wonders I
saw wholly revolutionized my soul. There was
height above height of snow that disregarded the
sun; or, if it yielded to its insinuations, it was only
to drip into bayonets of ice. There were cataracts
that had so far to fall, that the eyes reached the
bottom of the gulph first, and seemed only overtaken
by the waters with which they started.</p>

<p>I had nothing more to do with Bolingbroke or
with Goldsmith, in style; I had seen Nature play
the great idea and express herself. I learned that
she was the true stylist, and that she was not
inimitable.</p>

<p>I lingered at Florence and made acquaintance
with many there—native, English, and foreign.
Among these were Trelawny and Landor, whose
names still continue remarkable. Of the last I saw
little; he was preparing to drive himself to England
in his gig. He had greatly offended the Government
of Tuscany by the freedom of his speech, and
he became intolerable. This resulted in his being
served with an order to quit the country. When
matters came to so serious a pass, he was taken by
surprise. He called on the Grand Duke to remonstrate;
he told that amiable prince that it was an
honour to the country to have such a man as himself
residing in it; on which subject the Grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Duke agreed with him, and the edict of expulsion
was withdrawn.</p>

<p>He, too, was one of the artificial stylists.</p>

<p>People went little abroad in those days for want
of travelling accommodation, and the English generally
in Florence, were not of a kind to make a
favourable impression; many of them were ill-disciplined
in principle, and had become dregs who
reached the bottom, though there were many who
were quite as respectable at home as a thousand
miles off, and were absent on business only, economy,
or pleasure. Colonel Burdett, a friendly and agreeable
man, heir to the prince of Radicals, Sir Francis,
was a traveller on his way to Rome, and invited me
to accompany him; but I desired to be stationary
for a time, that I might acquire the lingua Toscana,
which I was learning under the Abbé Caselli.</p>

<p>Landor was not a nice man; he was violent in
his conversation: he thought it worth saying that
his ancestors were statesmen when Lord Mulgrave’s
were working in a ditch, forgetting that his descendants
in the course of things might be working in a
ditch while Lord Mulgrave’s were statesmen.</p>

<p>Then there was Dr. Bankhead, who was the
newsman of the fashionable past in all instances
where slander mostly fitted in. There was a
divorced, re-married countess who, as the wife of a
rich parson, was a leader, but whose story he ripped
open for the delight of all comers, at the same time
the nearer he might venture to England himself
the worse he would have fared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The relief in acquiring such companions is that
one never expects to meet them again.</p>

<p>I am probably the only one living who was
acquainted with Trelawny in his younger days.
It was during my first residence in Florence in
the years 1831-32. He was of a strong, noble
build, of quiet, gentlemanly demeanour, and of a
manner of conversation free from all display. He
was much courted by the English residents. His
adventures, his marriage with the maid whose
father’s life, the Greek chief Ulysses, he had defended
and saved, his connection with Byron, his cremation
and burial of Shelley, were in every mouth, and he
is undoubtedly one of the celebrities of our time.
His likeness was taken by Kirkup, an English artist
who lived and died at Florence, and who was
the discoverer of Dante’s portrait, now universally
known.</p>

<p>I knew Kirkup well. He was a pleasant companion
in those early days, over sixty years ago; he
afterwards became entangled in the superstitions of
spiritualism, all through lack of that physiological
training which should be given to all, and but few
enjoy. These shocking errors of the mind, to which
not even the cattle are liable, appear to gratify their
slaves for a time; but they have no ultimate value,
only encouraging the clear-sighted to look down on
their fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>It is only due to the memory of Trelawny as a
hero to record here that the English women, married
or single, old or young, were crazed as Juliets about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
him, at the same time that they were gushing over
with stories of his cruelty to his lovely wife, whose
hair, trailing on the floor of Ulysses’ cave, he was
said to have stripped off to the roots in a moment of
anger.</p>

<p>There was a good anatomical school at Florence,
of which I did not fail to profit.</p>

<p>On this my first visit to Florence I got to know
many new things—the meaning of the fine arts, the
beauties of Michael Angelo, Cellini, and Bruneleschi;
the mysteries of Dante, Boccacio, Petrarch, Alfieri,
Ariosto, Tasso; so I returned richer than I went.
But of all the persons I remember, Madame Catalani
is foremost in my memory; she is never to be forgotten.
And till I returned to the city again, I
lived within sight of the Palazzo Vicchio, the Duomo,
and the Campanile.</p>

<p>Lord and Lady Holland occupied the British
Ministry at Florence. Among other English
families resident there were Lord Burghersh; Lord
Mulgrave, a great musician; Sir Henry Floyd,
Lady Peel’s brother; Dr. Bankhead; Kirkup, the
artist; the Perrys, the Losacks, and several others
with and without handles to their names; Mr. Hare
among them, still guessing at Truth. Among natives
was the incomparable Catalani. The English, or
most of them there, were awaiting events, making
pleasant homes, until future prospects came closer
and within reach.</p>

<p>At Sir Henry and Lady Floyd’s I met with
Colonel Burdett, the brother of our best lady, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Baroness Burdett-Coutts, whose estimable acquaintance
I made more than half a century later.</p>

<p>The Marquis Spinelli was very fond of the
English and a great favourite with them, acting as
a medium between our countrymen and his own.</p>

<p>What an experience and toning a young man
gets from a residence of this sort, in a favourite
foreign city, at an age when his sap is rising, and
has yet to burst out and congeal into full leafage!</p>

<p>I am not going to describe Florence; my love
of it will come out better when I visit it again.</p>

<p>All was new to me then! Imagine only what
it is for such sweet little cities as Piacenza, Parma,
and Modena to be new; imagine Milan to be seen
for the first time, after architectureless Brighton!</p>

<p>I remained at Florence, a voluntary seeker after
knowledge, a great part of 1831 and 1832. I then
went into Switzerland by way of Milan, Como,
Lugano, Bellinzona, Zug, Zurich, Schaffhausen;
made acquaintance with Strasburg, Stutgard, and
several other German cities, not omitting the
Rhenish and other German towns, ultimately reaching
Brussels and home.</p>

<p>Before long I was at Brighton again on a visit
to the widow Wallinger, my faithful and generous
aunt.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_30">XXX.</h2>


<p>I once was spoken to by a king; I had great
anticipations. When I saw him, I found, to my
astonishment, that he was only a man. I had to
go on a knee and show my affection for him, which
I did not feel, by kissing his hand, which was large
and flabby. This gentleman was named William;
there had only been three of that name before him.</p>

<p>The next day I saw a queen; her name was
Adelaide. This lady bowed to me, smiled at me.</p>

<p>This introduction did not lead to any intimacy,
as may be supposed, but it entitled me to the
acquaintance of our ambassadors abroad, and to the
<i>entrée</i> at foreign courts.</p>

<p>On the evening of the Drawing-Room, my friend
Mr. Nussey took me to dine with Sir William
Martens, at St. James’s Palace. He belonged to
the Court, and on the subject of royalty was
emotional.</p>

<p>The conversation turned on the ladies at the
Drawing-Room. I spoke of a daughter of Lord
Stewart de Rothsay as the one great object of
admiration. He went into raptures over the name,
and congratulated me on having seen the most
beautiful woman of the day.</p>

<p>This lady married the Marquis of Waterford,
and is the mother of our naval hero, Lord Charles
Beresford.</p>

<p>An old friend of mine, Madame Gandillot, whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
I knew at the late Lady Ripon’s, was brought up
by Sir Herbert, the Privy Purse, and Lady Taylor.
I heard from her many amusing anecdotes of the
king and queen, one of which I may relate. Sir
Andrew Buchanan had just returned to England,
and was at Brighton, where the Court was staying.
It was suggested by Queen Adelaide to dress Sir
Andrew as a Turk, and to inform the king that the
Turkish ambassador, whom he expected, but did
not then know, desired an audience of him. This,
by the assistance of the Taylors, was fully carried
out, and Sir Andrew, fully disguised, was introduced
by Sir Herbert; the queen, Lady Taylor, and
my friend being the only persons present.</p>

<p>The king received the supposed ambassador
graciously, but looked puzzled; he received his
message in due form, but still had a puzzled look, as
if, as was surmised, the face of the envoy was not
new to him. So the interview passed off, to the
great amusement of the queen, followed by no
remark from the king either then or after.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_31">XXXI.</h2>


<p>Again at Brighton. I may here say, the delight
of myself and brother to this day is the recollection
of Mrs. Wallinger, our aunt, long gone, and of the
eccentricity of her mental powers, increasing as time
went on.</p>

<p>I have spoken of her often in an earlier page,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
but her sayings were really droll enough to be put
on record. I often make the new generation laugh
by repeating them.</p>

<p>When she had done anything that gave her a
triumph, she would say to one of us, “Did I not,
my dear, show my great good sense? Am I not
always right?” Of course we assented with a smile
of mental reservation.</p>

<p>As she grew old and less capable, and ceased to
feed her friends, she dropped into a more melancholy
mood, and, looking upwards with her fine
large eyes, and a sigh, would say, “What a world
it is, isn’t it, my dear? Here we are, my dear, all
alone, one with another.”</p>

<p>She did everything in her power for her relations
with kindness of heart and ample means, but it only
made her feel that she was everybody’s victim, so
all her good deeds made her sorrowful.</p>

<p>She reached to a very advanced age, when her
decay of memory showed itself in a curious manner;
she would forget, in part, the very subject she was
dwelling upon. Thus, when the sad story of Sir
Thomas Troubridge was made public, that he lost
both arms and legs in the Crimea; that the lady he
was engaged to marry before the war did not shrink
from her pledge on his return, she was greatly
impressed by the circumstance, and would say, “If
it had been me, my dear, I could not have married
him. I know it would have been very dishonourable
of me, but I should have said, ‘Sir, I can’t!’
Only think, my dear, how dreadful it would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
been, he in so helpless a condition, not able even to
wash his own hands!”</p>

<p>Some in this mental state will in speaking forget
even their last word, when it has served as a clue to
the one that comes next. Thus, such a person
repeating Lord Lytton’s earlier names, Sir Edward
<i>Lytton Bulwer Lytton</i>, would never stop, because
after Lytton he is necessitated to say Bulwer, after
Bulwer, Lytton, after Lytton, Bulwer again, and so
on for ever.</p>

<p>When the memory begins to fade, the ghost of a
word sought still haunts the mind, and by dwelling
on it for some time, the substance will return to the
shadow, and the word again lives. The memory
must be far gone to encounter total obliteration—threads
to every subject long remain; but the
difficulty, then the impossibility of finding and
taking up the thread at last follows. The lady of
whom I have spoken, the kindly aunt, was brought
up at Exeter. I once asked her if she remembered
Northern-hay. Her reply was, she had never heard
the name. I spoke of other places, beginning with
St. Bartholomew’s. We lived there, she said, after
we left Bowhill House, and we used to walk up
Fore Street to St. Sidwell’s, and then across
Northern-hay Hill.</p>

<p>I have mentioned how in her better days this
generous, kind-hearted lady felt herself the victim
of her family, spontaneous as was her interest in all
that concerned them. My mother, while we were
at Brighton, had a fall on the stairs, which produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
a severe dislocation of the hip-joint. I hastened to
Mrs. Wallinger’s house to acquaint her with the
distressful news. She evidently took in all at a
glance, with the weeks of kindness she would be
compelled to bestow on the sufferer, and her first
remark, accompanied with a sigh and upturned,
pathetic eyes, was, “Is it not very hard on me, my
dear? To think of my family!”</p>

<p>I must not omit a very frequent saying of this
lady. Her house was a model of cleanliness, and to
that virtue she would allude with pride. “Cleanliness
is next to godliness,” she would say; “for what
else is there, my dear?”</p>

<p>I cannot resist noting another favourite exclamation
of hers, always uttered when any event, serious
and unexpected, transpired. On such occasions, she
would look piously upwards, and say, “Does it not
show how true everything is, my dear?” just as if
the whole of the holy Scriptures had suddenly flashed
across her mind.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_32">XXXII.</h2>


<p>In my earlier days I was intimately acquainted
with the Earl of Elgin, whose name is co-immortal
with the marbles of ancient Greece. It shows what
an amiable man he was to have taken so much
notice as he did of a young man so insignificant as
myself, and to have introduced me on equal terms
to his wife and family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>How fortunate is London to contain the Elgin
Marbles and the Raphael Cartoons, which, exclusive
of the Venus of Milo, and the Last Supper of
Leonardo da Vinci, are of greater worth than all the
other sculptures and paintings in Europe.</p>

<p>I knew Lord Elgin in London and Paris; it was
when his great diplomatic career was ended. He
was a patient sufferer from facial neuralgia, and was
under the treatment of Hahnneman. He was
unable to speak, for the motion of his lips left a new
paroxysm of pain. So he wrote what he would
have said, and on one occasion he placed the words
on paper that violent as his suffering was it was due
no longer to the disease, but to the medicine that
was administered. A remedy in homœopathic hands
is thought to occupy the disease, and by slightly
exaggerating it to effect its cure.</p>

<p>Lord Elgin would have liked to see me one
of Hahnneman’s party; he introduced me to the
physician. I saw some of the practice, but always
left in exactly the same state of mind as I went.</p>

<p>I sometimes joined the family party at dinner in
Paris, so I knew Lady Elgin and her two daughters
who were then single. I think the eldest was called
Lady Charlotte, the youngest was Lady Augusta,
who became the wife of Dean Stanley.</p>

<p>The manner and ways of this family were of the
simplest; there was not the slightest show of rank
in anything they did or said.</p>

<p>Afterwards, in London, the earl brought his son,
Mr. Frederick Bruce, to see me, and this visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
afforded me a pleasant recollection; for Mr. Bruce,
Sir Frederick afterwards, became a distinguished
public servant, and, when ambassador in China,
took a keen interest in Charles Gordon, and assisted
him in every manner in his power. He was tall of
stature, and a much finer looking man than his
eminent eldest brother.</p>

<p>Lady Matilda Bruce, afterwards Maxwell,
through her marriage, was the eldest daughter of
Lord Elgin by his first wife, and was the heiress of
her mother’s large fortune. I did not meet her, but
she showed me kindness through a common friend,
and when I visited Canada she gave me a cordial
introduction to her brother who was Governor-General
of that colony at the time.</p>

<p>There was a drama published by me in 1839,
called the “Piromides,” which many members of this
noble family took a pleasure in reading. It was my
first serious work, and was inscribed to the Earl of
Elgin, the late ambassador at the court of the
Sultan.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_33">XXXIII.</h2>


<p>As our latter end comes about, we reason on
and take stock of our friendships, chiefly those of
our youth. Our statistics, accumulating with time,
enable us to grasp the subject in its fulness.</p>

<p>People are apt to call their acquaintances their
friends because it sounds more important, but this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
a mistake; if I am known to have been on intimate
terms with a man for twenty or thirty years and I
speak of him as an old acquaintance, I have at least
the satisfaction of telling the truth.</p>

<p>A community of interests may last a lifetime,
and it may be as strong as that of the banks, which
would argue efficiency. Such is the friendship of
circumstance, but should the conditions change it
would vanish.</p>

<p>It seems to be a moral law of our species that
new friends, however gratefully they accept one’s
services, so long as they are needed, have a disposition
to drop off when they can no longer profit
by them. Such friendships are like a fever which
runs its course; a fever sometimes affecting a whole
family, and then not leaving a symptom behind.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a good acquaintance is a very
pleasant thing, even though its benefits on both
sides may balance and explain each other.</p>

<p>There are some who practice friendship quite
naturally, others who are only skilled in it as a game.
It would prove amusing to make a good classification
of one’s friends, as is done of the animal
kingdom, by dividing them into warm-blooded,
(hæmatotherma) and cold-blooded friends (hæmatocrya).
We are all too fond of forming friendships.
I have often observed that nothing is more
fatiguing than what is generally called a night’s
rest, unless it be the dream and its final result, that
we have made friends! Dreams are as laborious and
realistic as realities; the nervous powers are put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
through walks and conversings with strangers, as
well as acquaintances, some dead long ago. One
has introductions, dialogues as with the living; but
what is so amusing and ludicrous, many dream that
they have made new friends, to find it was in their
sleep!</p>

<p>Regarding friendship, how often it is only
theoretic; intimacy without intercourse; instead of
active only passive sympathy, the philosophical
equivalent of cement, such as isinglass or glue!
When friends have a common interest, how they
stick to each other! There is still another kind of
friendship of an agueish type, which one might call
intermittent. It has some foundation in a community
of nature, but is unable to sustain itself
continuously, showing itself in fits. It is the most
aggravating of all social alliances, and would be
better extinct.</p>

<p>At Brighton I enjoyed the inestimable friendship
of Sir David Scott, a leading magistrate there, of
very high social rank—in fact, the most important
personage of the place at a time when it needed
men of influence to direct it towards its present
unrivalled position.</p>

<p>As a young man, Sir David Scott succeeded to
the baronetcy of Sir James Sibbald, of Sillwood
Park, and he bore the addition of K.H.G., an order
that was extinguished with the severance of Hanover
from our ruling sovereigns, on the accession of
Victoria. This order, the use of which has been
very much replaced by that of the Bath, was conferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
on Sir David by George the Fourth, whose
life he probably saved by having a madman arrested
at Brighton, who was provided with pistols to shoot
the king. Sir David, a true gentleman without
being a courtier, and therefore at home in all that
related to good breeding, once gave me an amusing
account of his interview with the “first gentleman
in Europe,” telling with much gusto an anecdote of
the king’s studied elegance even in taking a pinch
of snuff. “I perceive, Sir David,” he said, “that
you take snuff; allow me to offer you a pinch from
my box.” This Sir David took, shaking his thumb
and finger over the box, as one ordinarily does, not
to waste any of the precious powder on withdrawing
the hand.</p>

<p>This was the king’s opportunity of showing
himself more advanced in gentility than his subject.
He said, “Now, Sir David, permit me to try a pinch
from your box.” The baronet drew forth his box
and presented it to the king, who, having secured
his pinch, withdrew his thumb and finger with careful
rapidity, evidently lest any particles that had
been touched should fall back into the box, and so
render the remainder unfit for use.</p>

<p>Sir David gave me an amusing account of how
the official who received him at court and introduced
him to the king’s presence became the great man
that he was. It was Sir William Knighton, who
had accompanied the Marquis of Wellesley as his
physician to Spain. It was said that Dr. Knighton
would never draw his salary, which he evidently did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
not wish to be paid in money. So at the conclusion
of his service the marquis sent him to the king with
important documents, which exactly suited him for
the exercise of his effrontery and self-assurance.
The gentleman-in-waiting, having an appreciative
and loyal mind, said, “You will be very much
surprised when you come to see the king.” Dr.
Knighton replied, “He will be very much surprised
when he comes to see me!”</p>

<p>So it turned out. The king was very much
struck with the physician’s manner and aptitude
for affairs, and before long made him his “Privy
Purse.”</p>

<p>At a time when the now proud town of Brighton
was only half built, Sir David purchased the estate
of an Oriental Company on the west cliff, facing the
sea. A building that was already erected on it before
the project failed, he converted into a mansion, which
he called Sillwood House: this he occupied himself,
with his family. On the ground in front were built
two elegant streets, called Sillwood and Oriental
Places. Later, on a portion of the ground, he
erected for himself a villa with an entrance on the
Western Road, and laid out a charming garden and
shrubbery there, where he lived for many years,
making his home the resort of a fashionable and
cultured circle. He was often spoken of as the
“King of Brighton,” and he certainly exercised great
influence there as a Conservative leader. At the
same time, he supported every charity in the place,
and materially assisted the Rev. H. M. Wagner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the then all-powerful vicar, in planting the town
with churches.</p>

<p>Sir David Scott had a pension given him by the
Government for saving the king’s life; this the
Liberal Parliament, on coming into power, withdrew—sorry,
perhaps, that such a life had been saved.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_34">XXXIV.</h2>


<p>A very remarkable character who used to visit
Brighton was the Countess de Montalembert, mother
of the nobleman of that name who made himself
known in France. She was the daughter and
heiress of Mr. Forbes, whose “Oriental Memoirs”
were much esteemed in his time. This lady had
friends among all sorts of people. While chuckling
over scandalous and not decent letters from Lady
Aldeburgh, she would be receiving the visits of such
uncontaminated beings as Lady Mary Pelham, and
conferring with her on religion. In her invitations
to me she would one day say, “I want you this
evening to come and meet the religious set:” this
would be such men as the Robert Andersons.
Another time it would be the worldly set that
she was to receive and I was to meet; and this
was certainly the most pleasant set of the two.</p>

<p>She had great <i>naïveté</i>, and was full of fun,
trenching often on those sources of humour which
are forbidden to delicate minds. Her literary occupation
at the time when I saw most of her (in 1837)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
was in writing a “Life of King David”—a work that
she completed with great self-gratulation, and which,
at her death, her executors burned without estimating
its worth, the quicker to dispose of her numerous
papers.</p>

<p>Her husband was a baron at Louis Philippe’s
court, and received the higher title from that
temporary king. His wife, being a Protestant, was
not admissible at court—a difficulty which she readily
overcame by crossing over the way to the Catholic
faith; and this she quitted when it was no longer
for her interest to remain in it.</p>

<p>She had two sons. She cared only for the elder
one. He lived in Paris, and at her death inherited
her fortune. She died of a quinsy at her house in
Curzon Street, about a year after the time when I
saw most of her.</p>

<p>She was sprinkled and crossed, at baptism, by
the name of Rose, which name may have suited her
well in her bloomy days, for late in life she had a
pleasing face, full of lively expression, with a fine
portly figure. She was fond of sketching herself
seated on a music-stool, which she called a Rose
sitting on a Thorn.</p>

<p>In the death of friends whom one sees from
first to last, witnessing their gradual rise and fall
simultaneously with our own, there is nothing
striking; but how different the effect on our minds
when we lose sight of them in their prime, and
reflect that their sturdy figures, seeming to be still
unobnoxious to change, lie prostrate in their graves!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
We recall them, and see them still in full activity;
they appear to have only gone away! So was it
with the kindest of men, my best of friends, Sir
David Scott, whose name and goodness deserve a
better monument. So it was with Mr. Wagner,
whose quick limbs and upright pleasant face appear
to be moving through the streets of Brighton at this
hour! I see him now rapidly turning the corner of
Castle Square into the Old Steyne! Then comes
back into view the rapid step of Horace Smith,
another celebrity of the place, with a pun almost
out of his mouth before we were within hearing of
each other! They all seem still alive!</p>

<p>Wagner walked through the streets as if they
were his own, reviewing the people as he passed
as a general would an army, now stopping, speaking,
laughing, now pushing on again. He had been tutor
in the Duke of Wellington’s family. The wonder
is that, with his firmness of purpose and successful
handling of men, he did not reach a bishopric up
to that of Canterbury itself. He might have led
even the House of Lords by the nose. But Brighton
was to him an episcopal see. He enjoyed the
patronage of nearly all the livings there, with the
monopoly of marriages, births, and deaths; building
church after church himself out of his own large
resources and the pockets of willing or unwilling
friends.</p>

<p>There was an abomination of doctors at Brighton
in those days, potent firms, chiefly on the Steyne;
but the class is soon forgotten, since they leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
nothing behind them but their patients and their
shops.</p>

<p>Among apothecaries, Newnham was prince. One
saw him walking across the Steyne, then red-bricked
for foot-passengers only, he wagging his head with
a look of triumph, and in gaiter attire; his face
nearly six feet above his shoes, with an expression
on it of the miracles that may be achieved by salted
senna alone, not to mention the openings artificially
made in veins with the mere thumb and finger.
But Newnham was a friendly, knowing character.
I think often of the advice he tendered me as a
young physician, “Never dine with a patient. Such
has been my rule through life; for if you do, sooner
or later you are sure to let out the fool!”</p>

<p>I must not omit the name, in these brief
memorials, of my cultured friend, George Hall,
a physician and still more than that, a gentleman.
As travelling Redcliffe Fellow, he spent ten years in
visiting Greek and Italian and Turkish cities, and
the chief courts of Europe. He was too refined
for a Brighton physician; few of his patients were
to his taste. When summoned to those who suited
him best, he passed hours with them instead of
sharing his time fairly among all. He had some
noble blood in him, according to rumour; but it
was of a sinister strain. This held possession of
him secretly, and influenced his life; but he found
consolation in marrying Lady Hood, a peeress of
very considerable fortune, and in retiring from the
vulgarity of physic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>The pun sacrifices the sense and purport to the
playful analogy. In the practice of this Horace
Smith expended the conversational portions of his
life. I told him, at one of Mrs. Smith’s evening
receptions, that a man known to us had injured
a limb while travelling in Norway. His reply was,
“I suppose a bear came and Gnaw’wayed his arm.”
His daughter, Miss Smith then, and I believe so
for life, was a quick and clever match for her father
in drawing him out. She had an open, good-tempered
face, with the eyes well apart, to which
her nose, following suit, owed a flatness. Most
auditors must have observed that all whom Nature
has favoured with a lying-down nose were let fall
by their nurse when babies in arms. Thackeray
was one of these. One would have thought they
would have fallen on their backs; but no, they all
fall on their noses.</p>

<p>The only authority for punning that I know
of is Aristotle; he recommends it to a pleader.
Horace Smith’s puns are yet remembered; the
one on elder-flower water was his best.</p>

<p>The evening receptions at Brighton were
pleasant pastimes, especially those of Lady Carhampton
and the Hon. Mrs. Mostyn, daughter of Mr.
Thrale, of Johnsonian memory. This lady, in
Sillwood or Oriental Place, near the Horace Smiths,
had a suite of receiving-rooms winding all round the
mansion, hung with pictures. In one room was
a couch enclosed by a silken canopy within a
recess, above which was gilded in large letters,
“<span class="smcap">Mon Repos</span>.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_35">XXXV.</h2>


<p>Any one who has enjoyed the help of an acute
mind in life must have concluded that the human
creature was not designed to be very intellectual.
It has great faculties, but these can do little more
than provide munificently for its wants. It solves
with facility all the problems of luxury and amusement,
but can for the most part no further go.
Nevertheless, there are a few of an intellectual caste,
living apart from the vulgar and ostentatious; these
force their thoughts on unwilling recipients, and
in what they produce give intimations of a higher
race than that of man being still possible, though
scarcely to be expected to spring from the few,
since the grovellers have so immense a majority.</p>

<p>The clergy of Brighton were adapted more to
the wants of the congregations than to those of
religion. One likes the clergy. They have a good
education up to the age of one or two and twenty,
and their profession is gentlemanly. If they renewed
their knowledge of science from time to time, they
would not interpolate nature with dogma, the effect
of which is more damaging than they can conceive.
To the eye clarified by impartial thought, it is like
a pimple on the face of a pretty girl; but it will run
its little course.</p>

<p>While at Brighton I first knew Count Pepoli, the
head of an illustrious Bolognese family. He was
the author of some pleasant works, and wrote the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
opera of “I Puritani” for his friend Bellini, the composer
who furnished the music. He was banished
from his country, and had his estates put under
forfeiture by Pius IX., whose utmost science could
do no better than proclaim the dogma of an immaculate
conception, and announce himself infallible,
as occupying upon earth the rotten throne of an
Almighty. Yet this gentleman, by the aid of his
superstitious adherents, was able to expel the best
families from Bologna, for not wishing to retain him
in his place of civil chief—put into that place by
those supernatural chemists, the cardinals, who, by
mumbling cabalistic words over a drink of wine,
could turn it into blood, and, by showing the whites
of their eyes, could metamorphose a mouthful of dry
bread into the flesh of Christ. They mean well,
they administer to existing wants; but the drinking
and the eating of these would be cannibalism of
the worst description, and this they have not the
imagination to perceive.</p>

<p>Pepoli reached England a poor man, though the
owner of many palaces and lands. He supported
himself by becoming, almost at once, Professor of
the Italian Language, Literature, and Antiquities at
the University of London, in Gower Street; and he
retained this post for some twenty years. When
the pope was shown the shortest cut out of Rome,
Pepoli rushed back to Bologna, and got hold of his
magnificent palaces once more, and recovered his
lordly position.</p>

<p>Some twenty years after this, when I last visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Italy, on my way to Rome I stopped at Bologna,
and inquired of my landlord, Pellagrini, the way to
the Palazzo Pepoli, which I accordingly sought and
found. It was a massive, ancient structure, and on
inquiring of the janitor if the count was at home,
was informed that his kinswoman, the Countess
Maria Pepoli, lived there; and I was directed to his
residence, which was a large building occupying one
side of an open <i>Place</i>, and which seemed only to
need a sentinel to complete its pretensions to being
a royal palace.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me, the count was at his
country seat.</p>

<p>This nobleman, while in London, married a
Scotch lady. My old friend, Mr. Plattnaur, kept up
a constant correspondence with the count, informing
him of all that happened to his English friends.
Plattnaur was very intimate with Mr. and Mrs.
Carlyle. The lady once asked when he would join
them at dinner. He replied, “If you please, to-morrow.”
“Yes,” she answered, “do come to-morrow:
it will be the first day of the chicken.”</p>

<p>I have not spoken of Sir Matthew Tierney, a
physician of Irish extraction, a good-looking plausible
man, always equal to the occasion, whatever might
fall in his way. He had the look of a baronet
when once you knew he was one—a title that he
won easily, by a stroke of worldly wisdom. When
George No. 4 was a Brighton man, reposing under
that Chinese umbrella, the Pavilion, he was surrounded
by physicians, one of whom, Dr. Bankhead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
I was intimately acquainted with in Italy during
1831 and 1832. Bankhead was a powerful-looking
Scotchman, with a large red face and hair to match,
living abroad for reasons, and practising among the
English residents at Florence, by whom he was
much liked and courted, and as little respected as
many of them were respected by themselves. But
all liked his anecdotes of life high and low, more
especially so did the men after dinner, when the
ladies had left the table.</p>

<p>He told me that he used to meet the king’s
physicians every morning before visiting the royal
patient, and that he and the others invariably passed
away an hour in inventing scandalous stories about
the aristocracy, calculated to give amusement and
pleasure to their patient. He had been Lord
Londonderry’s physician; with him he had lived in
town and country, and so had become acquainted
with the noblest in the land, and with all their foibles.</p>

<p>Bankhead knew the history of Tierney’s rise to
the summit, which had a very humble beginning.
The king, always self-indulgent, was of course always
ill. At that time his favourite groom, who was
suffering under circumstances similar to those of his
master, and could get no attention from the medical
men of the palace, consulted Tierney. That astute
physician saw his chance, and giving the groom as
much care as he would have bestowed on royalty
itself, effected a cure, which, commending itself to
the king, led to Tierney being summoned, and to
his advice being followed with marked advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Matthew kept up a handsome house at
Brighton, on the Grand Parade, where he resided
in the season, living in London during the fashionable
months. He was a favourite, and a man of
very pleasant manners.</p>

<p>As to manners, they make the man more than
doth the tailor, though he be a Stultz or a Poole.
Sir Matthew had the manner of a man of mark,
which consisted in his looking as if he had an
answer ready to any question before it was asked.
When he came into the committee-room of the
hospital, it was as if he had entered to do all the
business of the meeting, and to put everything
right, taking it as granted that confusion was in the
ascendant.</p>

<p>It was so with Sir David Scott. His quiet, pleasant
face was a signal for all to look at him, and to
feel that what he had to say would be more refreshing
than anything they could utter themselves.</p>

<p>Horace Smith’s face was of that free, smileless
expression, which clearly asked, “Do you want to
laugh? for, if so, I’ll make you do so without further
notice.”</p>

<p>As to Wagner’s face, it was one not easily
defined. The expression was pleasing without being
quite agreeable. It bore the candid threat of entering
on some business transaction, useful in itself, but
declining in interest the nearer it approached the
amount of subscriptions still necessary to carry out
as it deserved his beneficent scheme. Wagner in
one thing only was unscrupulous and devoid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
mercy—it was in ordering money out of one pocket
into another for the general good, as if parting with
it was the chief object in life, and to assist another
in doing so was benevolence itself, such as few were
capable of feeling towards a fellow-man.</p>

<p>How successful he was in taking every one into
partnership with him in such matters!</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_36">XXXVI.</h2>


<p>In those days Brighton was full of charm, more
so than now by a long measure. There was no
three-shilling railway; you went to and from London
with blood horses, driven by those nimble whips,
Sir St. Vincent Cotton one-half of the way, and by
the Marquis of Worcester the other half, within
five hours. A crowd saw your splendid equipage
start, whether from Piccadilly or Castle Square.
It was called “The Age,” and was a wonder of
the age.</p>

<p>Brighton then had a season; November was
the choicest month. The weather then was delicious,
and the upper stratum of society, by a mild
upheaval, was moved bodily from the metropolis to
the sea, without even a dress being crumpled or a
lace torn.</p>

<p>There were good angels in those days, as there
are now; and if one was not privileged, as I was
not, to see them under cover in such a conservatory
as the mansion of the Duchess of St. Albans, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
could meet them in full bloom out of doors on the
esplanade.</p>

<p>That beneficent duchess and her worthy successor,
Miss Burdett-Coutts, were constant visitors
at Brighton during the autumn.</p>

<p>I had many inducements to be at Brighton. I
was acquainted with all the medical profession
there; Dr. Price and the skilful Mr. Taylor, Mr.
Lawrence, Mr. Furner, were my particular friends,
and I knew the principal residents of the place.</p>

<p>I undertook the work of the dispensary, to which
I was physician for five years, and I joined the
Committee of the Sussex County Hospital, which
was the pet establishment of such men as Lords
Egremont and Chichester and Munster, of the
Duke of Devonshire and Mr. Lawrence Peel, all
of whom would spend a pleasant gossiping hour in
the committee-room from time to time; none of
whom forgot the wants of the institution.</p>

<p>While I was chairman of the committee it fell
to me to read out a letter from Mr. Lawrence Peel,
announcing his gift of, I think, two thousand pounds,
as a mark of gratitude for Lady Jane Peel’s recovery
from illness.</p>

<p>When I see a portrait of Lord Hartington, the
massive countenance brings the Duke of Devonshire
back into my mind. I need no portraiture,
but the name to bring the Earl of Munster back
to memory. These great men were as much at home
with us all as they were with each other, enjoying
the chat and the laugh without mannerism or <i>hauteur</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>It is through manners that all our intercourse
is carried on, and one would suppose that they
strictly represented the person. It is not so to
any great extent; fashion influences them, and they
become modified by imitation, so that they cease
to be anything very different from current coin;
like it, having the different qualities of silvery,
coppery, or golden; the same person expressing
himself in all three to different sorts of men—a
guinea’s worth to the physician, a shilling’s worth
to the beggar.</p>

<p>In my early days the tumid young men, rigged
out in newest apparel, would go up and down Bond
Street at a snail’s pace, doing no better than advertising
their tailors. Like handsomely bound volumes,
the contents inane, they were just as contemptible
as the “sandwichers” who now take their place,
bound in boards. None of these tumefied gentlemen
ever walked in a hurry, confessedly because
they would not have it supposed that they had anything
to do. But they had; they smoked cigars in
the open air, holding them in two fingers out of five,
the other three spread out like a fan, the hand
encased in lavender-tinted gloves guiltless of a
crease. They smoked weeds which were lighter
in weight than the silver they cost; they smoked
them in Bond Street, they smoked them in the park;
but as any lady of their acquaintance approached,
they ostentatiously flung them into the road before
raising the host—that is to say, the hat—a couple
of inches nearer heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>I remember well the time when no gentleman
was supposed to smoke; the habit was fit only for
the vulgarian. By degree the young officer, the
young squire, and the delicate-minded <i>parvenu</i> was
seduced into the allurements of tobacco.</p>

<p>The introduction of the cigar into society was
a great trial to the womenkind. At first a smoker
was no gentleman, and he only became one when
no gentleman did otherwise than smoke. The
Sybarites at the commencement of their new epoch
smoked only out of doors or in a room set apart for
the purpose; this was still a reason for the separation
of the sexes, but at length some beauties of
independent spirit assured the youth of their set
that they liked the perfume of a cigar, and from
that time the revolution set in.</p>

<p>The puppyism of that day was mere fashion, the
exercise of the imitative faculty which the monkey
is supposed to still retain. But fashion is not a
very durable religion.</p>

<p>The novelists, clever creatures, have shown a
fondness for making such inanities as I have depicted
very heroic on occasions, and as coming out
in quite a new character; but they have not said
why. The truth is that the vanity which begets a
dressy snob will ferment itself up into the leader of
a forlorn hope, and be thankful for the chance of
a Victoria Cross instead of the praises of the giggling
sex, whose blessedness threatens to keep them
single.</p>

<p>Some men are vain to the last; Addison was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
when he invited a nobleman to come and see how
a Christian could die; Dr. Donne was before parting
with his last breath but one or two—he was laid
out by himself. Women, too, are supposed to be
not free from vanity, not only up to the last, but
a little after, desiring to be called “beautiful corpses;”
and to this end they have directed their maids to
rouge their cheeks when they are no more.</p>

<p>These are the true lovers of art.</p>

<p>As we are on the topic, one may say the least
vain are those who die by their own hand, especially
with the aid of a pistol. These instruments do the
work of suicide with a very ill grace; the effect is
that however much the relatives may have wished
for a photograph to be taken after death, even that
consolation is forbidden them.</p>

<p>It takes two or three generations for the world
to forget it when a great man kills himself.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Life is a handsome present—no man earns it;</div>
<div class="verse">Ungracious therefore is he who returns it.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I could never regard a suicide otherwise than as
a very remarkable person, with inscrutable traits of
character; in truth, as a singular anomaly. Napoleon,
the most noticeable, perhaps, of men, because the
worst among conspicuous ones, could not reach the
courage to kill himself; bravery seems inadequate to
such a purpose. Butcher as he was, there was not a
sprinkling of self-destruction in him; his life was
more to him than the empire of the world which he
had lost, though that life was one of cancer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>I knew a man, a captain in the navy, retired, a
C.B., with a private income of £1200 a year, with
no expenses but those of a lodging, no wife or family,
who drowned himself because he was going blind,
and this being so he could no longer superintend his
affairs, and felt himself liable to be cheated, which
was more than he could endure—and it certainly is
a trial! This man was old and infirm, cool, unimpassioned,
not wanting in even spirits, and fond of
a joke. He had the full use of his faculties, and had
frequent conversations with a weak-minded medical
man, in the club-room over which he lodged, on the
nature of various poisons without his purpose being
suspected. It ended in his creeping into a water-cistern
under the boards of an adjoining room.</p>

<p>Most of us grow tired of living, but we prefer the
fatigue to nothing, though we may suffer pain that
is all but insupportable.</p>

<p>A man who takes his own life may be mad in
some respects, but not in committing the act, for he
always does it in the right way. If he fired at his
own bust instead of at himself, if he swallowed the
bottle instead of the laudanum within it, if he cut
his dog’s throat instead of his own, with a view to
self-destruction, it would be madness itself. But he
performs the act rationally and perpetrates it in a
strictly methodical way.</p>

<p>There must be two kinds of courage, one of
which is common to most men, and one which few
possess and none comprehend.</p>

<p>I am told that when a certain reporter attends a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
meeting on behalf of a journal and finds out, from
the speaker’s address, that the purpose for which the
assembly is convened is worthless, he retires; and
on taking up his note-book, looks at the person
speaking and says, “Go home and cut your throat,”—words
that might have well been addressed to
the Bond Street swells.</p>

<p>A steam-engine may be called the greatest of
inventions, and could the best one as yet constructed
have sufficient consciousness to register its excellencies
and defects, according to its own knowledge
and experience, it could not be accused of boastfulness
or self-depreciation. Again, if a dog could be
endowed, in addition to its faculties, with the power
of expression, and could define in exact terms its
sense of smell and so announce it more keen than
that of all other animals, it could not be accused
of vanity.</p>

<p>The steam-engine in its revelation might reflect
credit on its designer and on the man who constructed
it, and these might reflect credit on their
maker, but not on themselves; they had no hand
in the acquisition of their faculties. So with the
dog, it would simply make its statement, and in so
doing communicate a phenomenon that the science
of man would otherwise be slow to reach.</p>

<p>As it is with the dog, so it should be with men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
in giving expression to their natural gifts. A Shakespeare,
knowing and avowing himself to be a vehicle
constructed of phosphorized brain and ozonized blood,
through which the higher revelations of nature are
poured out on the senses of men, might describe the
glorious machinery as it worked within him; might
declare himself to be the most highly perfected of
human beings, and that without vanity or boast, but
not without a benefit to others, affording them details
concerning himself absolutely unattainable by ordinary
means; for no one has yet fathomed him as he
did himself, and his knowledge died with him.</p>

<p>If Lord Bacon had taken the trouble to explain
to us all about the wheels that moved his apparent
delinquencies, it would have afforded a scientific
lesson, and have ranked with his other essays. He
would have lost nothing by it; minds of the size of
his suffer nothing from opinion, and can be as indifferent
to it as a cat, or a dog, or a horse, or a cow
is to what we call decency. The degree of energy
people display in vociferating against the anomalies
of morals is the best measure one can have of their
own failings. If I were to hear a man rail vehemently
against a swindle, I should at once conclude
that the machinery of cheating within him was in
good working order, unless it had been his lot to
be the party swindled.</p>

<p>There is no genius without humour, at least no
literary genius, for that differentiating faculty is the
basis of all self-criticism. Men have been challenged
to define genius, and they have tried to do it without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
being asked. The fact is that clever people can do
nothing unless it is a little difficult; they cannot see
what lies directly under their noses, and one of the
truths so situated is that perfect genius has never
existed. Such genius as a man can possess is fragmentary,
never whole. He may have literary genius,
and that is enough for one. He may have scientific
genius, like Goethe, Oken, Lamark, Geoffrey St.
Hilaire, Darwin, Helmholtz, Davy, Faraday, Hunter,
Cuvier, Laenec; but many of these were poor creatures
in other branches than their own. He may
have genius in mathematical philosophy, like Newton;
but that great man had an intellectual weakness.
Real genius of the perfect kind would be more than
one man could carry; the ideal whole is broken up
and distributed in fragments, some immense, like
that falling to Leonardo da Vinci’s share, some small
and constituting mere talent.</p>

<p>I have somewhere a list of men of genius who
were originators, beginning with Homer as the
father of Poetry, and coming down to Goethe who
began the transcendental philosophy of to-day in
his “Metamorphoses of Plants;” and I could never
get beyond sixty or seventy names.</p>

<p>Any one giving an estimate of his own capabilities,
whether favourable or unfavourable, or both,
without illustrating what he states by his own work,
and by the opinions of competent critics, is an
egotist. If hereafter I should enter on the subject
of my mental capabilities, it will be on the principle
not of self-consciousness, but of mechanical candour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Having never ceased my work up to the age of
eighty-four, I may have within me an ample experience
of my mental operations; but any account
of these the reader has the advantage of testing
with what he finds his own superior judgment.</p>

<p>I produced very little in my early days, though
a passion for literary success then governed me, alternating
with a passion for scientific. A career in the
direction of either was impeded in middle life by
professional practice, which had its fascinations.
But the young have not really much that is worth
saying to the middle-aged or old. I had been
nourished on the Greek and Roman classics; under
the special influence of Herodotus I composed an
Egyptian drama of the time of Cambyses, and it
cost me much labour and greatly improved me in
the art of composing; but not having read it for
more than half a century I am quite unable now to
judge of it. The flight I know to have been high,
but whether through clear atmosphere or fog I
cannot say. Sir Sibbald Scott, son of my friend
Sir David, told me that he had seen the authorship
of “The Piromides” inquired for in <i>Notes and
Queries</i> at two different times. It was received by
the press as a work of solemn purpose throughout.</p>

<p>I may mention that Lord Elgin, to whom I
inscribed this play, thought it betrayed poetic taste,
and he expressed his opinion in warmer terms than
I cite.</p>

<p>It is surprising to witness how many good
writers of their own language there are in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
country: in reading the papers this is extensively
seen; the leading articles appear equal, all marked
by idiomatic clearness of expression. Then, in
literary criticism, it is noticeable how much deeper
the writers penetrate into the arcana, perceiving
what is rendered, and what is left wanting, in a
poetic composition, and that with a psychological
acuteness much more general than was met with a
generation or two ago. This is the more valuable,
since criticism is the profoundest of studies; it
demands an adequate knowledge of every science
and art, as well as a competent observation of
nature.</p>

<p>In speaking of my own intellectual mechanism,
this I say once more is none of my own, but an
instrument placed temporarily among visible things,
to reveal what it may to the less knowing.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_38">XXXVIII.</h2>


<p>It is my purpose in writing these Memoirs to
adhere rigidly to truth, at least in its essence. Should
I succeed in this, my work will be a very remarkable
one, almost unique. But, being a close observer,
I have noticed that those who always tell the truth
obtain immense credit, no matter how much they say
that militates against themselves. The pleasure of
speaking the truth at all times is immense. Lying
is a very peculiar art: some use it merely as a
convenience, and often have not the ability to forge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
a lie without including in it the contradiction. One
takes pity on this class, endowed only with a pauper
intellect and a pauper conscience.</p>

<p>Exaggerative liars are of a common class; it is
somewhat difficult to reach their motive, because
they neither serve themselves nor others. What
they chiefly exaggerate is incomes; it must be due
to a sanguine temperament.</p>

<p>The decidedly despicable liars are those who lie
about themselves; but these have not the shrewdness
to see their way safely. A man told me that he
had been dining with a distinguished party at a
certain club. He had not the knowledge necessary
to give his lie substance; he was not aware that
the rules of the club he named did not admit of a
member entertaining any stranger there.</p>

<p>These are the three sorts of everyday liars; it
is astonishing how completely every one knows
them as such without their being in the least aware
of the fact themselves, for we all pretend to believe
liars to their face!</p>

<p>It is like possessing a fortune to be endowed
with a love of truth for its own sake, and I doubt
if any man was ever truly great without it. The
mind of the truly gifted appears to me to lie parallel
with nature, so that if an idea comes into being, all
other ideas related to it are close at hand, and in
a line with it.</p>

<p>The value of this view to the science of criticism
is incommensurable: this I will now illustrate. The
idea and its relations, which increase its intensity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and beauty, may be variously expressed. Say
Shakespeare knew a girl who was in love but
concealed it, and so, pining, grew hectic and sallow;
but bore it with patience. Such would be the prose
version of the fact, and is not very emotional. But
the poet would look as steadfastly at the sufferer as
would a lover, then his sympathy would inflame,
and in the developing of his mental vision he
would see a rose that must prematurely perish
through the cankering worm that gnaws at its
heart. That rose is the hectic blush, its damask
is reflected on the maiden cheek as she pines. But
such an image cannot end here, this image of death
in life; and in the next parallel appears a living
monument of immortalizing sculpture beyond which
the mind cannot rise.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">(1) She never told her love—</div>
<div class="verse">(2) But let concealment, like a worm in the bud,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Feed on her damask cheek.</div>
<div class="verse">(3) She pined in thought,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And with a green and yellow melancholy</div>
<div class="verse indent2">She sat like Patience on a monument,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Smiling at grief.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Poetry is co-extensive with Nature, but cannot
exceed her limits. She has her mystical number,
which is three. Her suns rise; they reach their
zenith; they have their setting: it is their morning,
their noon, and their night. The earth has its three
dimensions; the elements and all the things it consists
of can assume but three forms, the solid, the
liquid, the gaseous. Her productions have their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
three stages, and, running through these, they begin
again. Man, in common with all that is organic, is
born, he lives, he dies; the plant yearly has its
growth, its flowering, its seed-time. This is the
trinity of Nature; and poetry, which is her vocal
manifestation, has its three parallels.</p>

<p>This truth, instances of which the reader himself
may multiply at will, serves to illuminate the poetic
argument which is to follow. An idea in imaginative
poetry, which is the greatest and the only truly great,
has three parallels as already exemplified; it cannot
have more, and to be of the highest quality it cannot
have less. There are as many sources of these
parallels as there are objects in the three natural
kingdoms, that most marvellous of the threefold
series, the conjoint animal, vegetable, and mineral,
in which all things subsist; in which every object
is an ante-type of the poetic evolution just defined.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that these parallels should be
separated by intervening details of any length,
whence it is that short passages, or short poems
like the sonnet, when woven with a due regard to
their effectiveness, become poetic gems. Such are
the first four lines of Shakespeare’s thirty-third
sonnet; such are Coleridge’s lines on “Time Real
and Imaginary,” and those on “Work without
Hope.” All these I will now cite, numbering the
parallels in their gradual ascent from the subject to
its evolution, and thence into its transcendental
expression in the ideal.</p>

<p>Shakespeare, in the citation “She never told her
love,” gives out his subject in five words; from this
he rises into the amplification of it through an exquisite
metaphor and thence inters its divine ideal
in imagery that can never be surpassed. Such is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the working principle in imaginative verse, and it
may be readily found that the principle does not
pervade narrative poetry except in authors of the
very highest class. It is the sure test of genius,
so sure that a classification of the poets, in the order
of their merit, might be based upon it.</p>

<p>It may be perceived that these poetic gems are
as perfect in themselves as any epic of many pages.
But as gems differ, so do these: the citations from
Shakespeare and from Coleridge have their parallels
in the line of ascent; they rise into their climax.
The question whether the expression “slugs leave
their lair,” should not be “stags leave their lair,”
might surely be decided by reference to the first
edition of “Work without Hope.” I possessed
Gagliani’s reprint of Coleridge in 1832; if “slugs”
in that issue stood as a printer’s error, the author
was alive to protest against it. However, in an
early edition of his poems, edited by Coleridge, I
find it is “stags.” I feel that it was consonant
with Coleridge’s mind to have begun the poem with
“Slugs leave their lair;” it is not only more musical
than “stags” through the triple alliteration, but
more orderly, beginning with the slowest of animated
creatures as typical of the condition of apathy that
he was himself consigned to.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_39">XXXIX.</h2>


<p>There are three lofty and emotional verses in
Wordsworth’s “Intimations,” which should be
spoken of. The first of these is a gem, and would
have been without flaw but that it begins in the
climacteric, while the subject and development of
it, which should come first, begin at the sixth line,
thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“It is not now as it hath been of yore,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">down to the end.</p>

<p>It is almost sad to observe what splendid
material Wordsworth sacrifices through his want
of poetic art.</p>

<p>The stanza needs no verbal correction; its fault
is in the misplacement of the lines. It is one of the
most important verses in the language, or I would
not trouble the critic about it, but I will ask him to
read it thus by transposing the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="center">(1. <span class="smcap">The Subject.</span>)</p>
<div class="verse">It is not now as it hath been of yore;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="center">(2. <span class="smcap">The Development.</span>)</p>
<div class="verse">Turn wheresoe’er I may,</div>
<div class="verse">By night or day,</div>
<div class="verse">The things which I have seen I now can see no more.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="center">(3. <span class="smcap">The Grand Climax.</span>)</p>
<div class="verse">There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,</div>
<div class="verse">The earth and every common sight</div>
<div class="verse">To me did seem</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Apparelled in celestial light,</div>
<div class="verse">The glory and the freshness of a dream!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The qualifications of one who could be classed
with the greatest of poets are deducible from
Shakespeare alone; they are as follows:—</p>

<p>1. Imagination.</p>

<p>2. Philosophic vision.</p>

<p>3. A sense of the ludicrous.</p>

<p>4. An emotional perception of beauty.</p>

<p>5. Harmony.</p>

<p>6. Art.</p>

<p>All of these might be dilated on, but not here.</p>

<p>It is a notable truth that the poetic mind never
appears fully to mature. A man often writes a
whole bible of verses, of which but one per cent., or
from that to ten, is worth preserving. If he produces
one or two favourite poems, a mild people
accepts the whole, but only feeds on the little
income of its large capital. A voluminous writer
may succeed in yielding a fine harvest on the
whole; the wheats beyond all praise, the barleys
good, the oats plentiful; but the roots indifferent
and the potato crop decidedly bad.</p>

<p>It would be a curious sight if one could inspect
the proceedings of Fame Insurance Companies, in
which Shakespeare had a policy for millions all paid
up, and invested in the hearts of generations
unborn; in which, if Coleridge has not a tithe of
the amount, he is yet rich with the well-earned
increment ever increasing; and Wordsworth, who
teaches moral as well as poetic divinity, is not very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
far behind him. There I pause, accepting contemporary
poets as more or less life-annuitants.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, no example of retrospective
imagination (it is at once so dramatic, so poetic)
like the opening words of Gloucester in the play of
<i>Richard III</i>.</p>

<p>Before Shakespeare’s day, drama and poetry
lived very much apart—one may say entirely
separate in the Greek; no less so than chemical
science and geology may do at the present time:
Shakespeare, in much of his work, made them one.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">in this the action is dramatic, the verbal structure
metaphoric.</p>

<p>The same is true of—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Nor made to court an amourous looking-glass;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">while the words,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber,</div>
<div class="verse">To the lascivious pleasing of a lute,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">surpasses both, as not being metaphoric, yet poetic
as well as dramatic.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the latter line—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“To strut before a wanton, ambling nymph,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">is most perfect in drama-poetic expression. It is
exquisite in its contempt; it is ever visible in its
movement; it is ludicrous too. Here lies the
highest triumph of poetry, to do that which ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
speech can barely effect in any single sentence—to
attain to the most beautiful expression
without a single metaphor; that is, by absolute
simplicity of speech.</p>

<p>Of course, metaphor is a great resource in composition;
it involves not only the fact, but its simile
in one and the same epithet.</p>

<p>The line in Hamlet—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">has as strong a simile in it, through “harrow up,”
as is contained in the expression—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Thy matted and combined locks to part …</div>
<div class="verse">Like quills upon a fretful porcupine.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But the last is pure poetry; the other is dramatic
poetry.</p>

<p>Of course, pure poetry has the highest quality of
all; it is so sincere, so convincing, that it requires
no help to render it beautiful and effective.</p>

<p>The whole address in <i>Hamlet</i> delivered by the
Ghost is free from metaphor with few exceptions
towards the end, as—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Make thy two eyes like stars dart from their spheres;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">also—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Like quills upon a fretful porcupine.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">These two lines are the only exceptions. They are
mighty, and at the very summit of human art, but
in this respect do not actually reveal more than may
be set forth in a pure simplicity of diction.</p>

<p>This great truth of truths was known to David<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and Solomon. It came to them as the only means
through which the interests of a pure humanity could
be enlarged on, and made to reach the heart.</p>

<p>Moses enjoyed the art, as shown in his account
of the creation; so likewise did the authors of
Esther, Ruth, and Job. It came to them because
their poetry was so human, and consisted not, as
it did with the Greeks, in exalting heroes and
conquerors.</p>

<p>It is easy enough to use simple language in
descriptive poetry or in prose; not so easy to attain
to sublimity by its means. To do this demands
genius of the first order. Shakespeare, the most
gifted of men, was not too great to employ it in
his highest achievements. He was a perfect master
of simplicity; he knew that there was but one simple
thing, and that was truth.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the lines that follow, are entirely free from metaphor,
yet no purer and nobler description ever found
utterance. The more a writer deviates from simplicity,
the less sincere he appears. Let every man
of genius mark my words, that He who delivered the
parables to the multitude was Sincerity itself; that
His teachings were allegories, but that metaphor
never crossed His lips. Take as examples those
exquisite poems—for such they are, unfettered by
artificial metre—the parables of the Prodigal Son,
and of the Ten Virgins: a critical reading of them
will readily reveal that not a single metaphor exists
in either, and yet what an elevated poetry pervades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
them! After perusing them, turn at once to
Milton and read his account of Satan’s exaltation
in hell—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“High on a throne of royal state which far</div>
<div class="verse">Outshone the wealth of Ormus, or of Ind,</div>
<div class="verse">Or where the gorgeous East, with richest hand,</div>
<div class="verse">Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold,</div>
<div class="verse">Satan exalted sat, by merit raised</div>
<div class="verse">To that bad eminence.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is great language, is marvellous, high-sounding,
impressive, but is it sincere? Would an
angel sent from heaven to report on the proceedings

this of what he had beheld?</p>

<p>It is grand, as is Homer’s exaltation of his
heroes; but does it touch the innermost heart?</p>

<p>This is said not to find fault; not to withdraw
admiration from one of the few who have made
their country famous before all other lands, for there
is time for all things; for</p>

<p class="noindent">and for sadness at the sufferings of humanity.</p>

<p>In writing about Shakespeare and Coleridge, I
have showed that poems from their hand, however
short, had the three essentials of art—that is, the
three parallels, not more or less—namely, the statement
of the subject, the development of it in detail,
and the climax. The bare statement of the subject
is the basis of the whole; the development employs
the retrospective imagination which embraces an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
acquaintance with all nature and human life; finally,
the climax involves the moral by means of the
prospective imagination or the circumspective, and
rises into the incommensurable.</p>

<p>An analysis of the parables shows that these
three parallels are invariably to be found in each.
A poet who cares little or nothing for nature uses
the introspective imagination, substituting himself
for the universe, whence his climax often sinks into
a mere reflection.</p>

<p>I would say a few more words on the subject of
parables.</p>

<p>Dr. Angus, the masterly author of an English
Grammar, defines the allegory, parable, and fable.
He says of the parable that it is an allegory of
something that might happen, written in metaphoric
language. This is an instance in which a great
scholar may err by dispensing with scrutiny and
relying on his instinctive belief.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_40">XL.</h2>


<p>But I must not forget that these records are
meant to be about myself, the author of poems and
other effusions let loose when from time to time
he drew out the spigot. The author’s insurance
policy is still under discussion. His trial is still going
on, as did that of Warren Hastings; it has gone
into a new generation, and some say that when,
like the traditional door-nail, he is dead, it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
terminate in his acquittal, it being found at last that
he did not make himself, but was planned out by
Nature to serve her purpose; having fulfilled which,
she withdrew the chemical compound of which he
consisted, and utilized his waste materials.</p>

<p>As said before, I had the “Piromides” printed and
published; it was by Saunders and Ottley, in 1839,
while I resided in Gordon Square on my return
from Paris, where I had spent twelve months in
making the acquaintance of scientific physicians,
naturalists, and others; going round the wards of
La Charité with Andral every morning at six
o’clock; attending the lectures on chemistry of
Thénard at a later hour, and revelling in the
bones of Cuvier’s osteological museum. I was
much with Milne-Edwards; and with Dujardin,
whose <i>éclairage</i> for the microscope I introduced into
London, lending mine to Ross and to Powell as a
pattern, and these opticians and their successors
have supplied the scientific profession with it ever
since. It consisted of an achromatic illuminator,
the invention of which Wollaston pronounced
impossible, and which Dujardin achieved.</p>

<p>In that year I made the discovery of an animalcule
in the liver; it was a time when such things
were unknown, now fifty years ago. This discovery
has recently attracted the attention of the Pathological
Society, who have given an account of it in
their “Transactions” for 1890, in a eulogistic tone.</p>

<p>In that year, too, I published “Vates.”</p>

<p>From 1839 to 1853, living in East Anglia, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
was engaged in an art-novel or romance, called
“Valdarno,” taking it up only from time to time, as
Goethe did his “Faust.” I began its foundations in
Florence, and published four numbers under the
title of “Vates,” illustrated by Charles Landseer,
and I then dropped it, as in costing too much
money it became a gift to the world. Dante Rossetti,
whose father was a professor at King’s, like
Pepoli at University College, used, as a student-boy
at the first-named, to purchase “Vates,” and
devour it eagerly; so he told me when many years
later we met.</p>

<p>Leaving the arena of letters and art for country
life, which is, however, worth seeing once, I settled
myself down in the monastic borough of Bury St.
Edmunds. Like all the old county towns, it was
formerly the little metropolis of a squirearchy, where
the dowagers retired for life into the family mansions.
The place has great architectural features
in the shape of abbey ruins, still haunted by the
ghost of Abbot Sampson; of noble churches, such
as are not built now; of Norman tower and Gothic
gateway, such as may never be built again.</p>

<p>There was no lord in the place to adorn it, but
there was a great plenty of the kind to bless it and
conserve it within reach—the Duke of Norfolk, the
Marquis of Bristol, and baronets sufficient in number
to engage the fingers of one hand when counted up.
But the town itself had its magnates; there was an
honourable Mr. Petre, brother of a lord of that
name, and an honourable Mr. Pellew, son of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
naval hero, and my own familiar friend, not to
mention an admiral of the great name and family of
Wollaston, and a post-captain, with a C.B. that he
never wore; and it must not be forgotten that the
august mother of the Bishop of London, Dr. Bloomfield,
also resided there, among others of great
worth, including a solitary baronet and his lady,
Sir John Walsham.</p>

<p>There was a famous grammar school, too, with
Dr. Donaldson of classic fame as head master,
which had supplied England with a president of the
Royal College of Physicians, Sir Thomas Watson;
a lord chancellor, Sir Robert Rolfe, Lord Cranworth;
besides a bishop of London, whose scholarship was
on a par with that of the most learned of the day;
and all these alive at the same time.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Bristol was the younger son of
the earl of that house, who was also Bishop of
Derry, and owing to his elder brother’s early death,
he became the owner of Ickworth, a park within a
short drive of Bury, which, including all the parish
and part of the one adjoining, lies within a circuit of
eleven miles. It is said that the father disliked the
son, probably owing to some act of disobedience,
and exercised his power of depriving the inheritance
of its charm. He destroyed all the fine old timber
in the park, but nearly a hundred years have
sufficed to restore it; and he left the plan of a
colossal palace, of which he himself erected the
central shell, and laid the whole of the foundations.
I was credibly informed that ten thousand a year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
was to be spent for fifty years, according to the
bishop’s will, to complete the structure.</p>

<p>The building was completed on the original
grand scale about fifty years ago, and it took fifty
years to finish. In the drawings of this marvellous
structure it is designated Ickworth Building, and it
bears that name, which, given it by Time, it will
always retain, for people call it by no other.</p>

<p>Ickworth Building was the design of a Mr.
Sandys, I believe a clergyman, not an architect by
profession. He had been much in Rome, as had
the bishop, who loved Italy, and lived more in that
country than elsewhere; and, though an absentee
bishop, the beneficence he exercised in his see was
so great that at his death the people of Derry subscribed
to raise a monument of their gratitude to him,
which stands near the building in Ickworth Park.</p>

<p>There must be descriptions of Ickworth Building
in works on architecture, and I think one will be
found in Mr. Rookwood Gage’s fine “History of
Suffolk;” but I do not possess such, and what I say
is from memory.</p>

<p>I have heard Lord Bristol say that often when
he looked out of window in the morning on the
new building from the old, he wished the earth
would swallow it up. One knows the feeling of
something always hanging over one; it is like
that of a man sitting underneath a gallows after an
execution.</p>

<p>The marquis might doubtless have eluded the
burden imposed on him by his father’s will, but <i>je<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
noublieray jamais</i> was the motto he inherited, and
he lived to finish his task and to enjoy the magnificent
dwelling-place as a home. The building
itself, wholly unique in grace and beauty, consists of
a central structure, almost circular, surmounted by a
dome, intended to represent the Coliseum; its summit
is belted by sculptures of the Homeric legends,
the work of Flaxman. There are two square wings
at a proportionate distance from the body of the
building, connected with it by corridors, each being
the segment of a circle, with its concavity to the
front. The left wing was designed for a picture-gallery,
the right one for a gallery of sculpture, intended
by the bishop to receive his collections of art.</p>

<p>The building is of white material externally; its
area is planted with cedars alone. Of all the palaces
and mansions I have ever beheld, it is the most
surprising; perhaps equalled only, though not in
grace, by the temples of India, with the designs of
which one is familiar.</p>

<p>The Pavilion at Brighton should not be forgotten
in such a comparison, but that is semi-barbarous,
while Ickworth is classic, of the Ionic and
Corinthian orders.</p>

<p>Approached by a serpentine road, its perspective
conveys the impression of a moving object; it
seems to swing round, as on a pivot, at every turn
one takes in driving towards the portico, now
slowly, now rapidly revolving, on its aërial axis, now
remaining still.</p>

<p>I am not aware of it, if what follows has ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
been put on record authentically, though it may
have been so in part. The earl-bishop lived much
at Rome and spent his large income in making a
collection of pictures and sculptures to fill the galleries
at Ickworth. It was at the time when we were
at war with France on account of Napoleon Bonaparte’s
usurpations.</p>

<p>The bishop having completed his collections of
sculptures made his arrangements for transmitting
them to England, when they were seized on their
way by Bonaparte as belonging to a British subject.
This act aroused a strong feeling of indignation in
the minds of the Italian artists, who had met with
so generous a patron in the bishop, and, that he
might not be a sufferer, they subscribed a large sum
of money and offered it to Bonaparte as a ransom
for the treasures he had put under confiscation.
Bonaparte took the money and set the collection
free, restoring it to their owner, when it was no
sooner despatched a second time than he seized it
again.</p>

<p>No more fortunate fate awaited the pictures. The
bishop succeeded in having them safely conveyed to
Dover, but while in the custom house the building
was burnt down, and the fine collection of paintings
was destroyed in the flames.</p>

<p>I was told by one of the family a singular anecdote
of the bishop. When at Rome he was invited
to a banquet by the cardinals, and, while the company
gathered, he learnt accidentally that the dining-hall
was over the debtor’s prison. His anger at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
burst forth and knew no bounds. He, a prelate of
the Church of England, was insulted; he had been
asked to dine over the heads of those wretched
prisoners who, during the feast, would be pining in
their narrow cells. His hosts naturally explained
that such an affront was unintended by them; but
he was not to be pacified. At length his course
was determined on: he would remain where he was
until a full list of all the prisoners’ debts was brought
him. For this he waited sulkily, and when it arrived
he wrote a cheque for the entire amount.</p>

<p>The prison doors were opened, and he sat
down.</p>

<p>The private history of a country has not the
same interest as the public, which is enduring; but
it has a charm and is instructive. Biology profits
by observing the influence of a higher life on the
temperaments of men, on their principles, their
manners, and their views. How different all these
become to what we meet with in the common working
men, from whom the best of us are descended!</p>

<p>The bishop was for some time confined by the
republicans in the castle of Milan, and afterwards
still remained in Italy, where he died in 1803.
Except the central shell and the foundations, Ickworth
was left for the next successor to erect: a
gigantic undertaking.</p>

<p>The Herveys were always distinguished by their
manners; Lord Hervey, in Pope’s time, was so
conspicuous on this ground as to be called “Fanny
Hervey.” It was with him, probably, the saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
arose that the human race was divided into men,
women, and Herveys.</p>

<p>The present Lord Arthur, now bishop of Bath
and Wells, has a manner which, once seen, could
never be forgotten. The same might be said of
Lord Charles Hervey, who, however, had taken a
different polish from having been a member of the
Spanish embassy.</p>

<p>Lord Bristol was at Ickworth chiefly at Christmas,
when he packed his house with all his descendants,
having a separate table for those who were yet
children.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the offices being in the basement,
half a mile distant, as people said, the dinner had
plenty of time to cool before it reached the table.</p>

<p>Lord Bristol was always very pleasant with his
guests: after dinner he would sit with his legs
crossed and enter into familiar chat on political
matters. He had veered a good deal towards the
Liberal side. I remember his saying to me, “It is
incumbent on us to move with the times; it was
very easy to govern when there was only a population
of eleven millions, but it is a different matter
now.”</p>

<p>Earl Jermyn was very unlike his younger brothers
and his father. He had a manner peculiarly his
own, a politeness so mingled with shyness that one
could not distinguish the one from the other, but
withal a commanding air. His countess, Lady
Catherine Jermyn, sister of the present Duke of
Rutland, had a most imposing figure, and was both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
beautiful and full of charm. She died in London in
her prime, so absolutely the prey of small-pox that
no feature was longer recognizable.</p>

<p>Lord Alfred was member for Bury at one time,
with Earl Jermyn, but he made no place for himself
in political life.</p>

<p>I was informed that the earl-bishop had built
himself a residence in Ireland, similar to the Ickworth
Building, but on a greatly reduced scale.
When I read Lever’s novel of “The Bishop’s Folly,”
I wondered whether its plot was laid in the place in
question. I quite read the work with the impression
that it was so.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_41">XLI.</h2>


<p>Much culture shows itself in the families of
Suffolk. I often thought it was owing to the vicinity
of Cambridge, which is not more than a drive of
thirty miles from Bury. This remark applies to
many of the resident gentry, and notably to two
sons of Sir Henry Bunbury: to his eldest, Sir
C. F. Bunbury, the late baronet and a distinguished
botanist, who was only debarred from a Fellowship
of Trinity by his being an heir to an estate and
title; an honour which his next brother, Sir Edward,
received, and who sustained his reputation in becoming
the most learned ancient geographer of the
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Henry, a lieutenant-general, was a man not
to be readily forgotten. He had a sound judgment,
was a constant reader of books, old and new,
a clear-headed critic of art productions, and he held
temperate opinions on national affairs; in fact, he
encouraged the repeal of the corn laws, though at
Barton and Mildenhall the owner of over fifteen
thousand acres of land. He was the son of a
famous man, the greatest of caricaturists, Henry
Bunbury, whose initials of H. B. were adopted by
one who came later and who reaped fame on the
bold impersonation.</p>

<p>Henry Bunbury was the friend of Sir Joshua,
and there are several Reynoldses at Barton Hall;
one of priceless value, a full-length portraiture of
Lady Sarah Lennox as Venus sacrificing to the
Graces—a lady destined to perform a notable part
in life.</p>

<p>It was said that her beauty was the exciting
cause of her sovereign’s madness, for it was well-known
that she smote him to the quick; but she
was fated to a higher lot, though her path to it
was thorny.</p>

<p>Lady Sarah Lennox was married to Sir Charles
Bunbury, the uncle of Sir Henry, a man in whose
life the world can take no interest, for he was
simply of the horse-racing class, the least admirable
of shrewd, clever men.</p>

<p>One may imagine the kind of character Sir
Charles was when it is told that he grew tired of
his lovely wife! She was finally divorced from so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
unworthy a partner, and retired to Ireland, in the
bitterness of her heart.</p>

<p>After a lapse of several years, Lady Sarah met
with a Colonel Napier, who belonged to the historical
family of that name, and she married him.
From that date her better destiny began. She
became a mother, but of such a family! Of her
five sons, three were Peninsula heroes, with the
friendly eye of Wellington always upon them. Sir
Charles Napier, the first general of his day; Sir
William, the historian of the Peninsular War; and
Sir George, a brave, good man, who was governor
of the Cape.</p>

<p>Another son of this great lady was a barrister,
and a fifth was a post-captain.</p>

<p>But to one, the only daughter, the sister in so
bright a galaxy, one may readily credit the charm
that attached to her! To complete the romance, she
became the second wife of Sir Henry Bunbury,
coming to Barton Hall, to find her beautiful
mother’s image there, where it had remained over
the great library mantelpiece, sacrificing to the
Graces still.</p>

<p>Barton was a comfortable home, and Providence,
to make perfection joyous, bestowed on Lady
Bunbury a niece whose countenance was the daylight,
whose voice was the music of all around.
This was Cecilia Napier, the only living child of
Sir George. She inherited the beauty and grace
of Lady Sarah, whose portraiture by Reynolds was
hers also. The family of Sir Henry came of a first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
marriage, but he loved the adopted one of his
second wife as his own. This lovely girl became
the wife of his third son, Henry, a colonel in the
army.</p>

<p>One would almost think that Providence was
the near relation of some families—it appoints them
to such pleasant places, makes them so welcome
upon earth, lets them want for nothing. So it was
apparently at Barton Hall, on which the divine
patronage was very generously bestowed.</p>

<p>As we learnt at school, <i>Natura beatis omnibus
esse dedit</i>. Still, as a physician would say, this is
only the predisposing cause; exciting causes must
follow. And here Providence steps in, with the
patronage of a prime minister, which is not, in
appearance, dealt out disinterestedly; but there is
not enough for all.</p>

<p>Sir Henry, on account of his conciliatory
manners, was selected after the war to communicate
to General Bonaparte his pending sentence of
lifelong exile. Sir Hudson Lowe might perhaps
have been as well appointed to the task, for the
ex-emperor simply burst out into a torrent of abuse
and rage, which not all the persuasiveness of the
baronet could soften.</p>

<p>Sir Henry began military life at the battle of
Maida, under General Stuart, and wrote an account
of it in pamphlet form, but I think not for general
circulation. He also similarly described his interview
with Napoleon. It gave a fuller account of
what passed than appears in Sir Walter Scott’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
work, which was borrowed from it by Sir Henry’s
permission.</p>

<p>Sir George Napier I knew very well; he was
sometimes at Barton. Sir Charles I saw only once,
and was charmed by the gentle and unpretending
manner of the man who had performed such marvels
of valour. When last in India, at the conquest of
Scinde, he contracted a dysentery, which afterwards
returned and proved fatal. He annexed Scinde, in
violation of the orders from home. Lady Bunbury
told me she had heard, but could not vouch for the
truth of it, that in his despatch to the Government
he announced what he had done in one apologetic
word—<i>peccavi</i>.</p>

<p>It was said that the moral influence enjoyed
over the troops by this great soldier even exceeded
that of his command as general.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to note that Sir Henry’s
successor, the late Charles Fox Bunbury, married
a daughter of Leonard Horner, a sister of Lady
Lyell. They lived at the old mansion at Mildenhall.</p>

<p>I knew Sir Charles Lyell in 1839, when I was
the bearer to him of some fossils; and I met him
with Lady Lyell and her sisters in 1853, when I
delivered a lecture to a select company in the
house.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_42">XLII.</h2>


<p>One’s memoirs never seem to end; the more
one advances the more one seems to remember. It
is like living over again on somewhat easy terms,
for a repetition of the reality would by all, if offered
it, be respectfully declined, even by those who
have passed through it the most smoothly. But
this revival of a long life in memory itself is a
good; one can set aside and suppress the bad feelings
that have had their place in alternate succession,
and can so purify being, though too late, as one
passes through it over again. We have all had
friends, and in thus reviving their recollection we
feel how far less stable within us are their failings
than their kindly deeds. The models of good men
are those who never speak ill of others; there are
many such, and in passing once more from childhood
to old age we may imitate them at last.</p>

<p>The Duke of Norfolk was a friend of mine, for
he sent me game at a time when he did not even
know me, with his compliments; the only man who
ever did so before or since. This good duke, this
most high and puissant prince, resided in a pleasant,
not pretentious mansion near Bury, from which he
drove in an open carriage with one horse on a
Sunday to his Catholic Church. It was said that
neither he nor his predecessor, known as Jockey of
Norfolk, were acquainted with their near relationship.
The duke whom he succeeded was said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
have once determined to invite all who were
descendants of his house to a banquet at Arundel,
but that when the number of claimants reached two
hundred, he paused and abandoned his purpose.
His next of kin, on whom I am now engaged, was
a man of business in the City; had his office, and
responded to orders for wine. While thus honourably
occupied he had to be looked up, and was
credibly informed that he was wanted, not by the
law only, but to take over the lordship of Arundel
Castle, together with the premier dukedom, besides
earldoms enough, and over a dozen baronies; a
number of peerages sufficient to constitute a full
committee of the House of Lords.</p>

<p>This nobleman thus entered on many homes,
but he preferred his own country seat, to which he
had been accustomed, to castle and palace, and
there, full of years and honours, he suddenly died.
His heir had gone by the historical name of the
Earl of Surrey, and his grandson by that of Lord
Fitzalan; but the latter at the duke’s death assumed
the earldom of Arundel and Surrey.</p>

<p>Lord Fitzalan, travelling in the Mediterranean,
had fallen ill. He was the guest of Admiral Lyons,
and became attached to the daughter of that heroic
seaman. This lady, who only died lately, was justly
beloved; her charity to the poor had no bounds.
A priest at Lymington, who was one of her almoners,
told me he could ask her for whatever he saw
needed by the poor, and, no matter what the cost,
it was given. The present duke is her worthy son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>The residence of the old duke, who lived there
now three generations ago, was at Fornham All
Saints, in a good park. After his death it was
purchased for a young man named Lord Manners,
the son of an Irish lord chancellor, and has been
resold. This fortunate youth had all his work done
for him beforehand. I met him at dinner often at
Culford Hall, and I recall my amused state of mind
at seeing him lean back in his chair and play with
a feather from the dress of a lady at his side, which
he peacefully blew up in the air.</p>

<p>In close vicinity to Fornham Park was another,
where stood a mansion which, if anything can do so,
must last for ever, not because of its strength, but
its beauty. This is Hengrave Hall, a proud example,
almost unique, of our domestic architecture. It is
very fully displayed in Rookwood-Gage’s work,
which I was once permitted to devour on the
premises. Sir Thomas Gage was the owner, but
he was very little there, preferring the society of
Vienna to that of his eastern county home. He
was of a knightly family, and himself an elegant
man of fashion; he represented the elder branch of
the Gages, the lord of that name notwithstanding.
His ancestor conferred a benefit on his country as
durable as sunshine and time, one that every Englishman
profits by and enjoys from childhood to old
age; he introduced the greengage from Vienna into
this country, and it has ever since borne his name.</p>

<p>I was just now speaking of Culford Hall, which
the press, no doubt on intimate terms with its present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
proprietor, Lord Cadogan, and acquainted with
all his movements, calls Culford Abbey. It is a
modern, monkless building, and the parish was once
a lordship of Bury Abbey; nothing more. The
place has an exemplary record; it was purchased
more than half of this century ago, of Lord Cornwallis’s
daughters, by Mr. Benyon de Beauvoir.
For several years he spent the rental of the estate,
some eleven thousand acres, in rebuilding all its
farmhouses and cottages, which done he entailed it
on his nephew, the Rev. Edward Benyon. It was,
like most of the great dwellings in the county, the
home of good company, hospitality, and sport: and
for pheasant and partridge shooting Suffolk is not
unfamed.</p>

<p>Mr. Benyon had no heir, and the estate went,
with another vast property of sixty thousand acres,
to the present Mr. Benyon, of Berkshire.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_43">XLIII.</h2>


<p>A family with which I was in close intimacy,
indeed on affectionate terms, was the Wilsons, of
Stowlangtoft Hall. Let those who from their disappointments
in life have formed a bad opinion of
mankind go among such people as these!</p>

<p>The father of Henry Wilson resided on his estate
at Highbury; he had been a great merchant, a
calling from which so many great things have
emanated in our country, and one which will cease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
to exist when we reach our socialistic days; for who
would give the energy of his commercial genius as
a servant of the State, and pile up tens of thousands
to enrich Cabinets whose members had better have
remained prize-fighters and the like?</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson purchased two baronets’ estates in
Suffolk—one of Sir George Wombwell, the historic
seat of Stowlangtoft; one, Langham Hall, the property
adjoining, of Sir Henry Blake. He also held
lands in Norfolk.</p>

<p>Henry Wilson, his son and my kindest and best
of friends, resided always at Stowlangtoft; at one
time he represented the county in Parliament. He
was educated at Oxford, where he made friends
enough to last for a lifetime, all of whom, like himself,
were thoroughly good men, and many of them
fellow-students of Oriel. There was Rickards, who
became his rector, a college-friend; and one of
those who joined the set of Newman and Manning
for a time. There was Porcher, Yarde Buller of
Downs,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Kindersley, Mozley; nearly all these were
guests from time to time of Rickards and Wilson;
in fact, the only one I do not recall as having met
at the hall or rectory was Newman.</p>

<p>It was a deadly surprise to Rickards when Newman
and Manning kicked against the Reformation
and became inceptor-candidates for the Papacy.
The Church, from its own point of view, may have
deemed it fortunate that these two gentlemen took
their stroll from Oxford to Rome, or they might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
have become Anglican archbishops, and have looked
the Holy City up later in life.</p>

<p>Sir R. Kindersley was a most genial man, quiet
and sensible, like most of those who rise to eminence.
He gave his daughter in marriage to Wilson’s eldest
son, and Wilson gave one of his daughters to
Kindersley’s eldest son, and a daughter by this
marriage is now Lady Herschell. Miss Wilson
had been long adopted by the Porchers, who wished
her and young Kindersley to be their heirs.</p>

<p>Henry Wilson had a large family by his first
wife, who was a Maitland. He married a second
time, the daughter of Lord Henry Fitz-Roy, a son
of the Duke of Grafton. This lady brought him
several children. She was a devoted mother to both
families; as conscientious a lady as was ever born
to fulfil great duties. She not only treated her stepchildren
exactly as she did her own, but acquired
for them the same affection as she felt for those
which she had brought into the world.</p>

<p>Those who knew her may think themselves
happy if they ever see her like again.</p>

<p>My first acquaintance with Sir R. Kindersley
was at a dinner at Trinity College, which I went
to with Dr. J. W. Donaldson, the Greek scholar
and philologer. Donaldson was then head-master
at the Bury School. It was my good fortune on
the same occasion to meet Professor Sedgwick, some
of whose anecdotes have served my purpose ever
since. A very good one was of a French general
who visited England and enjoyed Sedgwick’s attentions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
among those of many others. On taking final
leave of the general he asked him how he liked the
English ladies. After some hesitation the answer
came. It was: “I like them very much. They are
very beautiful, but they have one great fault; they
are too virtuous. <i>Elles sont trop vertueuses.</i>”</p>

<p>I reminded Kindersley of that pleasant dinner
when I met him again, and he remembered it well.</p>

<p>Wilson was boundless in his hospitality to his
neighbours, poor and rich. Could every parish be
under the management of such a squire and such
a rector, poverty would cease to be an evil. Wilson
may have felt this organically; it may have been
under its influence that he desired to establish his
family on the soil during succeeding generations.
He was an ardent admirer of enterprise and self-aid;
he turned his own name into his motto—“Will
soon will.”</p>

<p>He was bent on building a mansion on the
Stowlangtoft estate, and this he did ultimately on
a larger scale than had sufficed for the home of Sir
George Wombwell or of Sir Simonds d’Ewes, his
predecessors; but not before his father died, who
left him a purse of twenty-four thousand pounds
a year.</p>

<p>The old Wilson, the London merchant, told me
that he met Sir George Wombwell at his bankers’
to pay him the ninety thousand pounds in notes
which he gave for the Stowlangtoft estate, and that
the baronet stuffed the money into his hinder coat
pocket, and so walked away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>The old hall was a very comfortable one, commodious,
picturesque. A man does no good to his
family in replacing old mansions by new in country
places, to which the owner resorts, often, only for
the shooting season. This adding on to and rebuilding
often ends in disappointment to those who
follow later. I saw recently an advertisement in
the paper—“To be let, Stowlangtoft Hall, with the
shooting over seven thousand acres of land.” My
friend Mr. Thornhill, of Riddlesworth Hall, Norfolk,
enlarged his mansion, which had sufficed for
his wealthy father; he wished his descendants to
reside there for generations, but his son has thought
differently. I saw an advertisement immediately
under the above concerning Stowlangtoft, which ran
thus—“To be sold, the property of Sir Thomas
Thornhill, Bart., the well-known sporting estate of
Riddlesworth Hall.” How little influence can the
dead exercise over the living!</p>

<p>We must now speak of old Rickards, a name
he had gone by all his life, with the many who
loved him. His hair had always been white, his
complexion red, and he always blushed heartily
when he laughed. He had been a Fellow of Oriel
till he wedded Miss Wilmot, a daughter of Sir
Robert Wilmot, of Chadsden Hall, Derbyshire, the
liveliest, brightest, tenderest, sweetest of women; a
girl to the last; and I hope still alive, though all
this was fifty years ago. But every one is dead nowadays.
Time was when I saw in the paper the death
of some acquaintance almost weekly, then it got to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
monthly, then perhaps once in a year, but never
now, for every one I ever knew seems dead and
gone. I have a brother left, and a school-fellow
and friend;<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> all others appear children.</p>

<p>But how the newly dead who have lived in us
half a century and much more still survive and
perform their parts within us, still laughing, still
blushing, still merry, still sensible and intelligent
there, telling us all they ever told us over again:
still glad at seeing us, still shaking us by the hand,
still bidding us welcome. Yes, the obituary notices
of them were premature; they live while we live,
they die only when we die.</p>

<p>There is one soothing circumstance, however,
attendant on death: we do not miss ourselves when
we are dead; not so much even as we do a shirt-button
when we are alive!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_44">XLIV.</h2>


<p>Mrs. Rickards was a pretty creature, her husband
was plain, her daughter was plainer, but when one
looked at them, in the magic of the moment, they
all looked alike,—happy and good. One forgot
that beauty existed elsewhere, save as an art.</p>

<p>They were of course constant guests at the hall.
Miss Rickards herself painted, baked, and glazed
every window in Stowlangtoft Church.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Mozley, well-known as belonging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
to the Tractarian reformation, was an intimate
friend of the Rickards and Wilsons. He was one
of three or four who wrote the leaders for the
<i>Times</i>. His account of the duty, told only in
confidence to private friends, was that he and his
colleagues attended at the office every night at
twelve o’clock, one day excepted; and that a
committee was there, at the same hour, to discuss
the subjects of the articles for the day following,
and to determine the line to be taken. Then a
subject thus selected was handed to each of the
writers who were in waiting, in separate rooms.</p>

<p>On one occasion when Mr. Mozley was staying
at the hall, a <i>Times</i> commissioner was present at
the dinner. He was the bearer of introductions
to the various landowners; his mission was to
obtain information on subjects connected with the
land. He was not what one calls refined, and he
spoke with great freedom on the affairs of the
journal, not knowing that Mr. Mozley was connected
with the <i>Times</i>, but who was greatly amused at
this gentleman’s pretended knowledge about the
most secret details of the paper.</p>

<p>I was myself of the party, and, knowing the
situation, was equally amused, with the rest of
the company.</p>

<p>It occurs to me that the commissioner was
named Foster. He was sent about the country at
the time of the incendiary fires. The circumstance
brings to my mind a character living at Ashfield,
near Stowlangtoft—Lord Thurlow, grandson of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
great chancellor. He was a very shy man, and
at the same time very able, being a good chemist.
He conversed well, but with diffidence; the researches
of Liebig, then fresh, made a strong
impression on his mind, and I was able to draw
him out, being equally interested in them myself.
He had a fire-engine, and whenever a fire broke
out, he mounted his engine and took the direction
of the flames.</p>

<p>I am chary of introducing the names and places
of men who lived only for themselves. There are
families without any link between them and the
world at large who fill up certain gaps, but when
they die they seem to have been even of less use
than they were. These are not only in the majority,
but they constitute the bulk of the social class.</p>

<p>I must not omit the name of Henry Oakes,
the Suffolk banker, who, though not a public man
himself, gave his son to the Parliament as a Conservative
member. He lived at Nowton Court,
the residence of his father before him.</p>

<p>Henry Oakes was of a generous, confiding
character in proportion to his means. His son, the
borough member, inherited a kindly disposition not
only from him, but from his truly amiable mother,
the daughter of a bishop; and she, like her husband,
was well beloved.</p>

<p>The charming daughter of the house was
married to the son of Sir Henry Blake, whose title
she now shares, if, as I trust, she still lives.</p>

<p>I have not yet spoken of the Mills family of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Great Saxham Hall, which I do now out of pure
affection. They were connections of mine by
marriage, as were also the Carrighans of the
adjoining parish of Barrow. Mr. Mills and Mrs.
Carrighan were brother and sister. The Rev.
Arthur Carrighan had the rectory; it was in the
presentation of St. John’s College, and was once
held by Dr. Francis, the noted translator of Horace,
and father of Sir Philip Francis, the reputed author
of the “Junius Letters.”</p>

<p>Carrighan was a student and Fellow of St. John’s,
under the name of Gosli—a name adopted by his
father as a Sligo man, he reversing the syllables.
The history of this singular proceeding is associated
with a duel in which Mr. Carrighan, the father,
was led to believe he had killed his opponent. He
thereupon changed his name, and in an unhappy
state of mind wandered over the Continent for
twenty years more or less; when, one day, he met
the very man whom he supposed had received a
death-blow at his hands. On this important
discovery he restored his true name to his family.</p>

<p>Carrighan had many charms, but it will suffice
to say he was a gentleman and a scholar, which
includes all that is good besides. Sir Thomas
Watson, his fellow-collegian, was his attached
friend; I received the hearty thanks of that great
physician for my attention to Arthur Carrighan in
his last illness.</p>

<p>When one has been long on the Continent, he
no sooner reaches Dover than every woman looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
beautiful. How would it have been with him if the
first one whom his eyes fell upon had been Mrs.
Mills? She had a daughter, Susan, as lovely as
herself, who married Mr. Skrine, a considerable
Somersetshire squire, whose estates are within a
ride of Bath. Susan Mills had a most engaging
expression. A neighbouring squire, in his simple
way, said, “One can’t help falling in love with her,
she holds her head on one side, so pretty!”</p>

<p>I took Mr. Borrow, who was my guest, to
Saxham Hall with me to dinner once, but it was
the black eyes of another daughter that played their
conjuring trick on him. Long afterwards, his
inquiries after the black eyes were unfailing.
Saxham adjoins Ickworth, and Lord Bristol always
found it a very pleasant place of call, on account of
the charm which surrounded the family.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_45">XLV.</h2>


<p>George Borrow was one of those whose mental
powers are strong, and whose bodily frame is yet
stronger—a conjunction of forces often detrimental
to a literary career, in an age of intellectual predominance.
His temper was good and bad; his
pride was humility; his humility was pride; his
vanity, in being negative, was of the most positive
kind. He was reticent and candid, measured in
speech, with an emphasis that made trifles significant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Borrow was essentially hypochondriacal. Society
he loved and hated alike: he loved it that he might
be pointed out and talked of; he hated it because
he was not the prince that he felt himself in its
midst. His figure was tall, and his bearing very
noble: he had a finely moulded head, and thick white
hair—white from his youth; his brown eyes were
soft, yet piercing; his nose somewhat of the
“semitic” type, which gave his face the cast of
the young Memnon. His mouth had a generous
curve; and his features, for beauty and true power,
were such as can have no parallel in our portrait
gallery, where it is to be hoped the likeness of him,
in Mr. Murray’s possession, may one day find a
place.</p>

<p>Borrow and his family used to stay with me at
Bury; I visited him, less often, at his cottage on
the lake at Oulton, a fine sheet of water that flows
into the sea at Lowestoft. He was much courted
there by his neighbours and by visitors to the seaside.
I there met Baron Alderson and his daughters
who had ridden from Lowestoft to see him, and I had
a long talk with the judge on wine. Borrow, being
a lion, was invited to accompany me to some of the
great houses in the neighbourhood. On one occasion
we went to dine at Hardwick Hall, the residence of
Sir Thomas and Lady Cullum. The party consisted
of Lord Bristol; Lady Augusta Seymour, his
daughter; Lord and Lady Arthur Hervey; Sir
Fitzroy Kelly; Mr. Thackeray, and ourselves. At
that date, Thackeray had made money by lectures on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the Satirists, and was in good swing; but he never
could realize the independent feelings of those who
happen to be born to fortune—a thing which a man
of genius should be able to do with ease. He told
Lady Cullum, which she repeated to me, that no
one could conceive how it mortified him to be
making a provision for his daughters by delivering
lectures; and I thought she rather sympathized
with him in this his degradation. He approached
Borrow, who, however, received him very dryly.
As a last attempt to get up a conversation with
him, he said, “Have you read my Snob Papers in
<i>Punch</i>?”</p>

<p>“In <i>Punch</i>?” asked Borrow. “It is a periodical
I never look at!”</p>

<p>It was a very fine dinner. The plates at dessert
were of gold; they once belonged to the Emperor
of the French, and were marked with his “N” and
his Eagle.</p>

<p>Thackeray, as if under the impression that the
party was invited to look at him, thought it necessary
to make a figure, and absorb attention during the
dessert, by telling stories and more than half acting
them; the aristocratic party listening, but appearing
little amused. Borrow knew better how to behave
in good company, and kept quiet; though, doubtless,
he felt his mane.</p>

<p>Lady Cullum was a young woman of high
principle; she became a firm friend of Borrow for
many years after, looking him up in London when
he moved to Hereford Square. Sir Thomas Cullum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
was a quiet, kind-hearted man; he was the father-in-law
of Mr. Milner Gibson, who married his only
daughter, born of a first marriage. Gibson was a
man of pleasing manners; I remember his saying
that parliamentary life enabled one to bear anything
of an adversary with temper, except being touched
by him.</p>

<p>But I am sorry to say Borrow was not always
on his best behaviour in company. He once went
with me to a dinner at Mr. Bevan’s country house,
Rougham Rookery, and placed me in an extremely
awkward position.</p>

<p>Mr. Bevan was a Suffolk banker, a partner of
Mr. Oakes. He was one of the kindest and most
benevolent of men. His wife was gentle, unassuming,
attentive to her guests. In fact, not only they,
but their sons and daughters were beloved on
account of their amiable dispositions.</p>

<p>A friend of Borrow, the heir to a very considerable
estate, had run himself into difficulties, and
owed money, which was not forthcoming, to the
Bury banking house; and in order to secure repayment,
Mr. Bevan was said to have “struck the
docket.” I knew this beforehand from Borrow,
who, however, accepted the invitation, and was
seated at dinner at Mrs. Bevan’s side.</p>

<p>This lady, a simple, unpretending woman, desirous
of pleasing him, said, “Oh, Mr. Borrow, I have read
your books with so much pleasure!” On which
he exclaimed, “Pray, what books do you mean,
madam? Do you mean my account books?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
On this he fretted and fumed, rose from the table
and walked up and down among the servants,
during the whole of dinner, and afterwards wandered
about the rooms and passage, till the carriage could
be ordered for our return home.</p>

<p>Mr. J. W. Donne, the librarian of the London
library, and afterwards reader of plays, told me,
while he was a resident at Bury, that Borrow had
behaved in a somewhat like manner to Miss Agnes
Strickland, who, hearing that Borrow was in the
same room with her, at a reception, urged him to
make her acquainted with her brother-author.
Borrow was unwilling to be introduced, but was
prevailed on to submit. He sat down at her side;
before long, she spoke with rapture of his works,
and asked his permission to send him a copy of
her “Queens of England.” He exclaimed, “For
God’s sake, don’t, madame; I should not know
where to put them or what to do with them.” On
this he rose, fuming, as was his wont when offended,
and said to Mr. Donne, “What a damned fool that
woman is!”</p>

<p>The fact is that, whenever Borrow was induced
to do anything unwillingly, he lost his temper.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_46">XLVI.</h2>


<p>The Bullers, a political family, had a son who
filled the rectory of Troston, and were often on a
visit to him there. They were the parents of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Charles Buller, Lord Durham’s secretary in Canada,
afterwards member for Liskeard, and the pet of
the House.</p>

<p>These Bullers were much of the Lord John
Russell set; were friends of the Grotes, the
Nussau Seniors, the Thackerays, the Sidney Smiths,
the Walshams, and their like, not to mention the
Bunburys, all more or less <i>philosophers</i> of the
advanced type.</p>

<p>I liked Charles Buller’s company. He was good-natured,
moderate in his views, the friend of the
opinionated without being conceited himself. He
was a fine speaker, but afflicted with asthma, the
greatest curse that can befall a rising statesman.</p>

<p>I heard much about Whigism in this circle, and
always with disgust; they were too autocratic, too
grasping, too well off to obtain the confidence of
those who, at a glance, could see behind their
scenes.</p>

<p>There was Lord John, who began life as the
fool of the family; and this character in the Alabama
business reached its highest pitch. He was a sprig
of the dukedom, so he did not like that Mr. Delane
(the editor of the <i>Times</i>), and would not invite him
to his receptions. So <i>that Mr. Delane</i>, who knew
his own value, ordered the lord-John speeches in
Parliament to be only indicated in brief, not reported.
On this Lord John did like that Mr.
Delane, and sent him invitations; so his speeches
were reported once more in full.</p>

<p>He, too, must be an earl, and what are these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
beggars on England-back going to do with their
titles after all? One would think that a true man
would shrink from being mylorded by his filthy
valet; but they can bear it!</p>

<p>Charles Buller was a man for every one to love,
and he died too soon.</p>

<p>On the whole, Samuel Rickards’s parsonage
was the most literary house to be at, though his
knowledge was a good deal confined. But he and
his wife were open to everything, botany especially,
and antiquities. I recollect their showing me
an iron ring that had been dug up on the glebe,
which had an inscription on it that Rickards could
not interpret. It was <i>Bertus beriori</i>. I suggested
that it was monkish latin, and might signify <i>A
greatest to a greater warrior</i>, assuming it to be
derived from <i>berus</i>, <i>berior</i>, <i>bertus</i>, and this pleased
him much.</p>

<p>Who, belonging to the days of which I write,
does not remember the cheery voice and the bright,
handsome face of Tom Thornhill, the son of the
first winner of the Derby, and the inheritor of the
Norfolk estate, Riddlesworth Hall! Who has forgotten
his hospitality, and the famous still champagne,
the bountiful stock of which was left by the father,
and kept up by the son!</p>

<p>I often stayed at Riddlesworth with the Thornhills;
they saw a good deal of company there, both
from Norfolk and from town. Lord Sandwich was
very fond of talking to doctors, so they said; and
he often talked to me. I recollect his saying that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
his father-in-law, Lord Anglesey, forgot, not unfrequently,
that he had only one leg (for the sensation
of every part of the body is cerebral), and he would
sometimes jump out of bed in the morning as if he
had two, and fall on the floor.</p>

<p>I once accidentally met Colonel Keppel, the late
Earl of Albemarle, at the same house. I was then
staying at Riddlesworth, but there was no company
there, when Colonel Keppel was announced. This
caused some perturbation, as only a family dinner
was prepared. It appeared that the colonel was to
be of a party there on the morrow, but had mistaken
the day. All, however, went off well; and since,
when I heard of the homage paid him on his almost
last birthday, as almost the last survivor of the battle,
on the field of Waterloo, it recalled to me the charm
of his manner and conversation.</p>

<p>At the time his father and brother were still
alive, residing at Quiddenham Hall.</p>

<p>What one missed in these great houses was the
company of one’s own class, men in the pursuit of
literature or science; but such things are of no use
in the patrician circles, they would only be in the
way. These lords of the soil love horses, carriages,
plate, all of which one can see in great perfection in
the parks, and at the silversmiths’, as well as in
private houses, and the pleasure in any case is but
momentary. In justice, however, it must be said
that high-class people are often capable of conversing
with those who have little to show besides their
brains; and are not slow in eliciting information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
from them. Lord Sandwich was a good example of
such; but Lord Albemarle had a <i>naïveté</i> and an
intelligence so delightful as to need nothing at
another’s hands. Then, a rich aristocracy has
opportunities which do not belong to the men who
have their money to make. The one class has not
to consider in his dealings with others how he can
make the most out of them, but is able to be
generous; this alone has an ennobling influence.
An American made the remark that, many as are
the faults of the English nobility, they always kept
their promise.</p>

<p>The reason why authors, deserving of encouragement
from the intrinsic value of their work, are no
longer patronized and brought into notice by the
great, is that the influence of the nobility has wholly
died out. The literary leaders, great editors, and
the like, play but a minor part; they are not enough
looked up to by the people at large, who do not
understand them. They can confer fame on men
among their own select class, but that fame cannot
over-leap its boundary, and reach even the intelligent
vulgar.</p>

<p>Even the Royal Society, begun by a king, was
long afraid to venture in its career with anything
less than a royal or noble president, and this within
the memory of man; but happily it now runs alone,
as do all the other learned bodies in its track.</p>

<p>The truth may lie here—though scientific men

<p>I must not leave Riddlesworth without a tribute
to Mrs. Thornhill, a lady so conscientious; and that
means gentle, kind and full of charity. She was the
daughter of Mr. Waddington, of Cavenham Hall,
the county member; a devoted mother, a constant
friend.</p>

<p>I suppose, like everybody else, except myself,
she is dead; that class of people live too luxuriously
to last very long.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thornhill’s mother, Mrs. Waddington, was
a lady of extraordinary beauty. She was of the
Milnes family of which Moncton Milnes was the
recent head, a wit and writer who tried to legitimize
bad grammar on the liberal principle that every one
had a right to do what he liked with his own
language. He, too, like the brewers, could not do
without being a lord, though already a patrician,
which is greater, and which a king cannot create.
He was called the “Cool of the Evening,” which
must imply that he was a very pleasant guest on a
hot summer’s night.</p>

<p>Our country parishes, with their resident squires,
are really little republics with the squire himself at
their head as president, and the clergyman acting
as his prime minister. It is a form of paternal
government without the despotism. The parish
clerk, humble as he is, fills the office of a secretary
of state, the rest are the people. Where the squire
lives on his estate, how many of these happy republics
may be seen! All the parishes, pretty
much, that I have described are of this category,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and I hold it beyond human wit to improve them.
All are free!</p>

<p>Mrs. Newton of Elvedon was the sister of Mrs.
Waddington. The place of that name has since
become the property of Duleep Singh. In the time of
the Newtons it was no exception to the happily-governed
squirearchies of East Anglia.</p>

<p>Two or three places of mark remain to be
mentioned, and as many to be omitted, before
quitting the subject. One is the seat of the Duke
of Grafton, Euston Hall, inherited by the family
from Lord Arlington, in the time of Charles II.
The duke, who was Earl of Euston when I first
knew him, lived much on his Northamptonshire
property, but was a good deal in Norfolk too, where
his interests were large. He showed me the
principal rooms in his fine mansion, which, though
large, bespoke great comfort. The drawing-room,
which was very long, had bay-windows, with a daïs
under each for seats. There is a grand staircase;
on one wall of this was hung a portrait of the
duchess, mother of the first duke, then seven
or eight generations ago, a lapse of time when the
bar-sinister had ceased to cross the shield; nevertheless,
it was retained in the armorial bearings of the
house, and this may be regarded as a proper pride.</p>

<p>I was shown a picture of the hall as it was
originally, with gilded pinnacles, but these had
disappeared.</p>

<p>The usual entrance was at the back of the
building, flanked by the stables; the front entrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
was approached through the park gates, which, as
was an old custom, were never opened except to
royalty.</p>

<p>The duke, regardless of the example set by his
ancestors in contenting themselves with a life interest
in so fine a property, for the good of those to come,
was quite willing to sell Euston if he could have got
his price, but it did not change hands.</p>

<p>I was not acquainted with the duke in fashionable
life, so I know little of his character there; but
I believe he was thought to be eccentric. All I
know is that he was a benevolent and kind-hearted
president of his village republic. He was married
to the daughter of the last Earl of Berkeley—a sister
of the famed colonel of that name—a lady of great
worth. My acquaintance with the family was
professional only; in this way. I had to advise
several members of the house, and this sufficed to
confirm me in the opinion that the higher you go
the greater is the amiability you encounter. It may
be good breeding only, but whatever its source may
be, it is deserving of admiration.</p>

<p>One more place I will mention in Norfolk to
which I was summoned, the seat of Mr. Angerstein.
In point of decoration, it was a gilded palace, the
most superb in its interior that I had ever seen.
I remained there for the night, and had a most
agreeable conversation with the head of the house
and his two sons, the general and the member for
Greenwich.</p>

<p>Some very fine pictures remain in the mansion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
The one I was most gratified in seeing was a
Rembrandt, the finest almost of that artist’s work;
it was a Charles I., on horseback, under an archway.
I never met with the equal of this fine painting,
except in the equestrian figure of the Duke of
Galiere,—Brignole Sale,—by the same hand, in the
palazzo Rosso at Genoa.</p>

<p>I remember being told by General Angerstein
that his father had always regretted the sale of the
pictures to the nation, which was, however, made
compulsory by the terms of his predecessor’s will.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_47">XLVII.</h2>


<p>As the Lady Abbess of St. Albans might have
said, there was an abomination of parsons in the
county town; some schoolmasters who were not in
clerical practice, but cleric; some in actual service.
They did not in those days wear livery as servants,
not necessarily apostles, of I.H.S. Two of them
I still see talking automatically, faster than they
could think; one of these with the nose and mouth
of Punch. I still see another, a pale-faced pulpiteer
and a screamer; the confidence-reservoir of single
ladies turned forty odd; a man who met you with
a twirl of his glove by its finger, and a sort of
whistling smile that seemed to say to itself, “I have
done him before I have begun.” The men did not
care for him because what gossip is to some was
censoriousness in him; still the women liked him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and thought five of his ten toes were already in
heaven.</p>

<p>The parsonics are the only professionals who do
not seem able to get their own living by going into
practice—they like to be endowed. Some are glad
to get a hundred pounds per annum for life; some,
doing the same work as they do, bid for two, four,
six, eight, and ten hundred; others, with yet less
work, accept much more than this; but they have
uncles. Why don’t these guaranteed rats set up for
themselves in practice like the nonconformists?
They would be found churches. Doctors do so,
and lawyers. They should obtain the licence like
these, then preach what they liked within limits,
prescribed by the Royal Church. Doctors do all
this within the rules of their royal colleges.</p>

<p>Imagine the great profession of physic endowed,
and its baronets, arch-doctors of Canterbury and
York, giving away livings to their nephews and
nieces: the doctor of St. James’s £1000 per annum,
the doctor of St. Giles’s £150. It is a little so with
the law—the chancellors, attorney-generals, and
judges are endowed, but not so the barristers, except
with wit; and what poor creatures would these be
compared to what they are, if they had to begin on
curacies, and, perhaps, end on them, say of £100
per annum, unless they had influence enough to get
themselves made vicars of law, rectors of law, as
well as deans of arches?</p>

<p>But no Church has ever reformed itself: <i>non
possumus</i> is the motto of them all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Church has got its large fortune safely
invested, and in the best order, as if to make confiscation
easy. Its proprietary consists of human
beings not differing from others, and rich in worldly
wisdom. If they really wished to save the Church,
they would do their utmost to throw off the State
and take their money with them, and reform themselves
on the model of the civil service and the
army, dividing the revenues into livings of equal
amount, to be gained by competitive examinations.
But human nature must have its way; it will last
their time, and after them the deluge. In two or
three more new parliaments they will be too late.</p>

<p>In the present condition of clericism, many do
not know what to be at. An intimate of mine who
would have liked to steal a spiritual march on me,
which no man ever did yet, was a curate of twenty
years’ standing, and so far a perpetual one in the
sense of being the hireling of vicars and subject to
a month’s warning, like the moon. He had subscribed
his mite of belief to the doctrine of eternal
punishment.</p>

<p>This good personification of humanity had a
vivid notion, together with an unwholesome fear, of
our modern Hades, formed originally out of a few
metaphors of Scripture, and improved by Dantesque
and Miltonic talent, though its latitude and longitude
is still undiscovered among the heavenly bodies.</p>

<p>This well-meaning teacher, some two or three
years after my accident (a leg divided against itself
so that it could not stand, and made into two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
unequal halves at the socket), suggested persuasively
that I must have felt very grateful to the Almighty
at not being killed outright. But he was so much
at fault that I avoided the discussion, and answered,
“I am my own chaplain, and transact all my
spiritual business myself, under my own frontal bone
(<i>os frontis</i>); but should I be in want of spiritual
assistance, my inclination would be to apply to the
Archbishop of Canterbury or to the Bishop of
London as the best authorities in Divine practice.
However, not to be over reticent, I may tell you
that no sense of future favours as regards gratitude
arose in my mind; for we cannot entertain two ideas
at once, and mine was to ask myself, as a scientific
physician would do, whether my leg was as I last
left it, or whether the head of the femur and the
shaft had parted company. As to thankfulness at
not having lost my life, that would have involved
an emotion functionally incompatible with the faintness
and pain that got hold of me. The pain has
continued; I am taken prisoner by it, and condemned
to an armchair for life. Not unfrequently,
therefore, I think how much better it would have
been for me had I been killed off at once. So you
must perceive that your forecast is made without
any knowledge of the facts.”</p>

<p>A doctor never gives his opinion of another
without being called in; why, then, should a parson?
But it was well meant, though deficient in the
greatest of delicacies, called tact.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_48">XLVIII.</h2>


<p>Among the clergy of Bury was a curate, I think
of St. Mary’s, who was named Cookesley. His
mother was a school-fellow of my mother at Exeter,
now about a hundred years ago! He became intimate
with me, and was often my guest. He was a
son of Dr. Cookesley, D.D., and a brother of a well-known
man who was long an assistant-master at
Eton, and was as such spoken of with great favour
by Beaconsfield in his novel of “Coningsby.” Afterwards
he had a church at Hammersmith, St. Peter’s,
and lived in that place, where I knew him, and
attached much interest to his acquaintance. He
used to dine with me at Alton Lodge, Roehampton,
which was within a walk of his house. Cookesley
was, above all things, a good fellow, besides being a
good scholar and a most amusing companion. He
was a sturdy Churchman, and much mixed up with
the writers of “Essays and Reviews”—Dr. Temple
(now Bishop of London), Dr. Williams, and their set.</p>

<p>I introduce the name here on account of
Cookesley having attacked Donaldson’s work, by
pamphlet, on the subject of “Jashar,” the name of
a Latin book of great pretensions and no authority.</p>

<p>Donaldson, previously mentioned by me, was in
many things a good fellow too, but owing to his
overweening vanity, which had no repose, he was
incapable of the higher virtues. That vanity which
stands in the way of friendship, even of truth itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
was his to a degree that may be pronounced
abnormal. He wanted to be thought the greatest
of Bentleys, the cleverest of Christian Voltaires, the
choicest of wits; but a man who is now two-thirds
a scholar and one-third a wit may, if very vain,
conceive himself to be a Dr. Parr.</p>

<p>I liked Donaldson much, not very much, and as
character is of no use after a man is dead, it no
longer subserving his human interests, I wish to do
him justice, for better as well as for worse, since he
was a man to be biographized for the common good.
For some years I associated with him almost daily,
walked and talked with him, dined with him in
many houses, in his as well as my own, knew his
thoughts, his opinions, and was conversant with
whatever he was about.</p>

<p>His disposition was candid, genial, good-natured.
He was a child in his love of fun, and had laughter
enough in him to respond to all the humour ever
uttered by word of mouth, from Rabelais to Molière.
I was going to say he had not a bad heart; I will
go further, and say that I am sure he had a good
one for an occasion, but not one of a serious and
responsible order.</p>

<p>But these excellent qualities were marred in
him, not unfrequently, by a vanity which was
incommensurable.</p>

<p>I would not undertake to pronounce him blamable
in anything he did, said, or wrote; I am a
physiologist in judging of good deeds, a pathologist
in judging of bad. When I call up Donaldson’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
head and face, and see a large, wide, overhanging
forehead, big enough to be hydrocephalic, a forehead
such as one meets with in cases of epilepsy
and in cases of genius alike, I pause before criticising
its function; and such was Donaldson’s forehead,
while his mouth was the mouth of Punch. Its laugh,
almost always silent, seemed loud, and suppressed
only to make it last the longer. There was more
going on always under that forehead of his than in
any half-dozen brains of the common type. Fortunate
for him was it that the mental workings are
inaudible, or he would have been stunned by his
own thoughts; so busy were they at all times, and
so noisy.</p>

<p>He was a work of Nature, a thinking and sensitive
machine, which set going must work on like the
rapidest wheel moved by steam; so rapid sometimes
as to acquire invisibility as it revolved before your
eyes.</p>

<p>The fly-wheel—that wonderful invention of
machinery that carries the largest wheel over the
dead point—in him was vanity, and it never allowed
its machinery to pause; it was, therefore, quite
impossible for it to ask itself if it went wrong when
it never stopped. All Donaldson knew about right
and wrong was that what he achieved was perfect—that,
even if a little wrong, the reason was not quite
within reach of vulgar scrutiny.</p>

<p>Cookesley was the first to take unfavourable
notice of his “Jashar;” Perowne was the next.
Neither wrote of it dispassionately, but this was in no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
very unkind spirit. Their criticism was as they felt
to be just. The origin of “Jashar” was partly told by
Donaldson in his reply, but he was not over-candid
in his details. From his account he was only going
to pursue a course that others had taken: Welcker,
in collecting the fragments of Æschylus; Meinche, in
doing the same for the Comœdians; and so on for
Alcæus and the Lyric Poets, without a thought, he
said, on their part of also doing what he had done
for Jashar—an omission at which he expressed his
great surprise.</p>

<p>Now, the surprise he here expresses is not a real
transcript from his memory; the labours of which
he speaks he had been long acquainted with. He
had himself edited the works of Pindar, <i>with the
fragments of his lost compositions</i>; which circumstance
would have included him among those at
whose shortcomings his astonishment was expressed.
But I may say he only imagined himself so astonished,
on writing his <i>Præfatio</i>; for I know perfectly
well that one evening, when dining with Sir Thomas
Cullum, the worthy baronet showed him Knights’s
volume, with plates, “On the Worship of Priapus,”
and that it so attracted his fancy that he borrowed
it and took it home. He showed it to me soon
after—it might have been the next day—and told me
that he had caught from it an interpretation of a
certain text of Scripture, viz. Genesis iii. 8-15.</p>

<p>Out of this, and a certain plate, came “Jashar,”
which, whether true or false, scholarly or unscholarly,
is a wonderful intellectual feat; and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the subject is susceptible of treatment under new
accretions of knowledge, justice must be accorded it
as a first and bold attempt. The part relating to
the worship of Priapus, which immediately follows
the Prolegomena, is a marvellous evolution of the
verses cited.</p>

<p>The details would be in place if printed in an
anatomical work; perhaps next to that they are best
buried in Latin.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_49">XLIX.</h2>


<p>It was an easy task for a scholar like Perowne
to penetrate Donaldson’s plot, but the marvel is that
it should have deceived its author, who had so acute
a mind. The pointing out of its obvious fallacies
was a vexation, but the replying was a pleasure, and
was intended for a fresh literary feat. The worst
of it for Donaldson was that the day of invective
had gone by; the finest satire that could be written
would have remained unread. It was therefore a
poor substitute in the case for a sound refutation,
which alone could have extricated the offending
scholar from his dilemma.</p>

<p>Perowne almost justly accused Donaldson of
maliciousness; but I believe that it was boast, an
attempt of the criticised to establish his superiority
to criticism itself, unaware of the weakness of his
weapon, the use of which a century before might
have led to his being called the greatest controversionalist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
of his day; and, though his invective was
powerless, he believed that he should be so esteemed
in a century to come.</p>

<p>Donaldson had immense merit. While an articled
clerk he attended lectures at University College,
and, so disclosing a facility in acquiring Greek, went
to Cambridge instead of pursuing law any further;
and, in the short period of his terms, not only did
the work necessary for the examinations, but came
out the second classic, beaten only by Kennedy.</p>

<p>Such men should reap all their fame in their
lifetime, like men of science. Their names are soon
lost in the history of the knowledge wherein alone
they survive, unless they are Scotts and Liddells,
to be hourly referred to. Donaldson was a lifelong
student, impelled by vanity, the motor-power of all
noble work, but which, as in his case, often breaks
up the brain prematurely. By his “Jasher” and
his “Varronianus,” he was accused of striking a
blow at the Church. He may have done so
against its dogmatists and bigots, but he broke his
knuckles even in that slight aim. They would
have liked to have received him as Professor of
Greek at Cambridge; they told him so, but they
did not dare elect him.</p>

<p>Donaldson, as the world goes, was a good
citizen, and unexceptionable as a husband and
parent. He was not sympathetic; the advancement
of friends delighted him as gossip, but did
not touch him much within.</p>

<p>He was too active in his movements, mental as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
well as bodily, to be profound; he had not sufficient
pause. Expediency with him did not go
against the grain. In matters of religion he was
fully aware that, though the thumb-screw, rack,
and faggot had fallen into disuse, their office was
exercised by public feeling as their successor,
through which men stood in terror, not of their
lives, but of their living. On these grounds only
Donaldson quoted Scripture against Perowne in
his controversy with him. This served his purpose,
as he had no other moral philosophy to quote. But
he did not give the slightest adhesion, really, to
any kind of dogma. Science alone will reveal to
great and modest minds the truth that the best of
men cannot credit themselves with their own goodness
They might as well assume that they made
themselves; but religion has to teach this to
common understandings.</p>

<p>I can assert of Donaldson that what he says in
his “Reply” is most strictly true of himself—</p>

<p>“Doubtless it is the duty of Christians to be
patient under injuries. But our Saviour has expressly
said (Luke xvii. 3), ‘If thy brother trespass
against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive
him.’ On this rule I shall always endeavour to act.
I bear no malice against any man in this world.
And those who are acquainted with my life, know
that, when I have been wronged, I have always
been willing to welcome the first advances towards
reconciliation.”</p>

<p>I said to Donaldson once, “Why in your laborious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
efforts do you refute the fallacies of our Church
by learned quotation, when they are so obvious to
the simplest reason?” His reply was, “You
forget that I am a Doctor of Divinity.”</p>

<p>Verily the divines are the most potent of metaphysicians.
What beautiful systems have come
down to them from the ages that produced a
Pythagoras and an Epicurus! They now anticipate
all things, interpolating Nature at every point with
dogma, to satisfy the desires of the millions in every
new generation!</p>

<p>One cannot but admit that metaphysicians are
clever, but they have not the active industry of
the experimental classes, who realize that there is
nothing for them beyond the actual phenomena,
although it demands the most effective operation
of their intellects to arrange these in the order of
their succession.</p>

<p>The why and the wherefore of the universe, and
of Nature as its conductor, is, for a very simple
reason, quite impenetrable; so completely so that
the uneducated peasant will always know as much
about it as the president of any learned society.</p>

<p>For the benefit of those who do not quite see
this, and who think that things may be one day
cleared up, on this one spot, it cannot be too definitively
stated what a human intellect is at the utmost,
and within what limits its activity lies.</p>

<p>This intellect is a mere organic tool. It can
only operate on efficient causes, which here mean
the moving functions of a universal machine in full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
activity already. It can see, hear, taste, smell,
and touch; it can set the results of sensation in
order, and observe them as a whole, and choose a
line of action coincident with them. It is a mere
instrument for effecting these ends.</p>

<p>This is the whole story of Nature. She reveals
herself as a function, acting continuously before
senses which are mirrors; and here lies the absolute
limit. She reveals her Efficient Causes without
affording the remotest glimpse of her Predisposing
Causes.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_50">L.</h2>


<p>All know how tired the patrician gets of perpetual
country life; and in that one respect I was a patrician.
I had seen the things most worth seeing in the leading
towns of Europe in my early days; and had a
longing to witness how forty or fifty millions of
people got on in the new country of Canada and
the United States. I had a fancy to see Quebec.
I had a grandfather who was on the staff of General
Wolfe, and who saw him die. I had a great-grandfather,
also a British officer, father of the above, one
David Gordon, of Park, who was on duty at Halifax
and there met his death and burial. Not that I
would cross the waves on these accounts; I simply
wanted change, so sought it in New-idea-land, U.S.
I went to Philadelphia, thence to Columbus and
Galena; from Galena round about, crossing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Mississippi on foot over its admirable winter pavement
when boats change places with sledges. Then
I went to Boston, thence to Quebec; from Quebec
to New York, not to mention all the stoppages at
intervening places; from New York, after not a few
circumgyrations, I found my way back to London
again.</p>

<p>I saw a large portion of the New World; it proved
to be exactly what a hundred people had described
already, and I do not care to add my account,
only to make up a hundred and one American nights
entertainments.</p>

<p>My ghost of travel not being yet laid, I took
to the waves again and sojourned for a while at
Jersey, where I had relatives and friends. At
length I settled down in Grosvenor Street, Park
Lane; when I was invited to take charge of the
Earl of Ripon’s health at his villa on Putney Heath.
After a lapse of time, I took a small house in Spring
Gardens; later on, I built myself a villa on three
acres of park land at Roehampton; then, still later
on, I lived for some years at Parson’s Green, Fulham;
and after some more movements, in separate years,
now to Florence, now to German-Saxony, now to
Venice and Rome, which last visit was eighteen
years ago, I am settled, perhaps for good, in St.
John’s Wood, where I am within an easy distance
of Highgate Cemetery; so I hope a one-horse coach
will end my journeys.</p>

<p>On looking for the moss I have gathered I find
its quantity very small.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>At my leisure I hope to fill up the gaps left
between the skeleton outlines of my map of life—what
remains to be said, extending over the nett
balance of my years, of which I seem to have more
to say than can reasonably be expected of a man
past his eighty-third birthday. But I have been
asked to write a memoir, first by one, then by
another; by one who has long been, and who continues
to be, the greatest master of heart-finding fiction
in our time. One comes to me and asks how I
get on with it. One reads a portion and calls it
interesting; so, in a way, I am urged on with my
task.</p>

<p>At Boston I dined with Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence;
he formerly filled the United States Embassy at our
Court. He was gentleman enough to have been
an English duke. He had nothing to say about the
old country that was not good and admiring, and
told me many anecdotes of his own country people
while in London.</p>

<p>Remarking on the strict etiquette observed by
us, in never addressing a man you are not introduced
to, he observed that he sat opposite to another every
morning at breakfast in the Athenæum Club, for
two years, without their exchanging a word, when,
one day a carriage called to take him to a country
house, and he found his silent companion already
seated in it. In this way they became known to
each other and entered into conversation. To give
effect to his own story, a countryman of his own,
he said, came to England and travelled all over it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
without introductions, and calling on him he said
that he had not been able to speak to any one for
months, and being one day on the chain pier at
Brighton, he could bear it no longer, and observed
to a gentleman there: “It’s a fine day, sir!”</p>

<p>But Mr. Lawrence, instead of condoling with
him in his trials, replied: “I wonder at your
impudence!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lawrence did not appear to have been at
all Anglicized; she rather looked for perfection in
the English undergoing the process of Americanization.
Sir Charles Lyell had been a good republican
when in the new country, she said, and had greatly
improved through his visits, but not so fully as she
should have liked; and this she emphasized in good
Yankee brogue. I was acquainted with Sir Charles;
it was on his introduction that I came to know the
Lawrence family; and I never saw a sign in him
of such improvement. I was among his friends
in Boston; on his introductions I saw Mr. Prescott,
but he did not impress me.</p>

<p>My experience of Americans is that they are
less advanced in the art of humbug, and therefore
more earnest and sincere than the British. They,
therefore, perform the duties of friendship with great
thoroughness.</p>

<p>An interesting feature of immorality has often
struck me: it consists in the never-failing breach of
promise made in all the apparent sincerity felt by men
who do not fail to keep their word. Such men—I
could give the names of many for recognition—are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
very peculiarly framed. They are contented with the
thanks one feels on a kindly proposition being made
by them while they are with you; not caring to
gather the gratitude attendant on the completion
of a promise. I know men who play this skeleton
part every day of their lives, and I class them with
swindlers.</p>

<p>As one advances in life one gets to know the
sowers of this harvest of tares, and to separate them
from those of the wheat crops, without fouling one’s
barn with the results of their labour; the effect of
it being merely amusing at last. What cruelty it
can inflict is practised on children and young people.
They are born with implicit confidence: to them it
acts educationally. It affords them a most thorough
teaching of mistrust, which, more than any other
branch of education, makes a bad citizen.</p>

<p>Some evils in life are unavoidable, but the training
that comes from behind the falsehood habitually
worn by an amateur friend is not one of these.</p>

<p>These moral ornaments of the social system have
a game of their own to play; they know no other,
and they play it with all the <i>finesse</i> exercised over a
game of whist.</p>

<p>This recalls Mr. Stillman to my mind, almost the
only one of Rossetti’s set whom in this sense I
can refer to with unmixed pleasure—Stillman, an
American gentleman of high culture, and his faultless
lady, a Greek by birth! He is now the <i>Times</i> correspondent
in Rome. I have met him and lost sight
of him often, and when I meet him after an interval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of years, he is always the same kind, attentive friend,
though we have no interests in common beyond each
other.</p>

<p>It having been made known at Boston that I had
certain scientific tendencies, I was invited to deliver
a lecture there. It was not the season for such a
purpose, but the influence of the Lawrences sufficed
to get an audience together of about fifteen hundred.
I gave a choice of some subjects, as “The Correlation
of Forces, Physical and Vital,” “The Cyclical
Phenomena of the Universe,” and “Sleep, Dreams,
Somnambulism, Sleep-talking, and the Mesmeric
State.” The last subject was selected, and the
lecture was received with great politeness by an
attentive audience.</p>

<p>I had intercourse with several leading medical
gentlemen at Boston, and was treated by them with
much hospitality. They have a method of maintaining
hospitals peculiarly their own, much of the
money being subscribed out of their own pockets—all
for the good of their science.</p>

<p>Dr. Warren was at that time the most noted
physician in Boston. He gave me some brochures
of his writing, one alluding to the reflex actions of
the great sympathetic nerve. I found it very suggestive.
He had taken the trouble to collect all
that had been written on the sea-serpent, and to sift
the statements of travellers by sea, with a resulting
belief in its individuality.</p>

<p>It was at New York that I made the valued and
intimate acquaintance of Mr. Bancroft, the historian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and his lady, a truly noble pair. Mr. Bancroft was
a man of universal knowledge. This he showed
conspicuously in a lecture, the title of which I have
forgotten, but not the contents. Its purpose was to
show the rapid and far-reaching advance that science
had made up to that day.</p>

<p>I met again at New York that gifted artist, Mr.
Lawrence, whom I had known in England. He
preceded Richmond, and was his equal in drawing
likenesses in chalks—works which are much prized—among
them those of Thackeray, Tennyson, and
other celebrities.</p>

<p>I visited Quebec, and at Lord Elgin’s, the
governor-general’s, had the pleasure of meeting the
present Lord Albemarle, then a youth. At the
same party I became acquainted with Mr. Lawrence
Oliphant, who, later, becoming a writer, I may as
well depict the impression he made on me. He was
a little man, his manner very gentle and sympathetic,
with such amiability of countenance as to leave little
room for intellectual expression, though no doubt
his abilities fell little short of his good intentions.</p>

<p>I must mention the kindness shown me at New
York by the eminent house of Middleton and Co.,
whose friendship in financial matters I have availed
myself of to this day. The family belong to the
West Indian islands and are British.</p>

<p>I pass over my explorations in the south and
west; they were the same as other people’s, now
well known to book-life; but I do not forget that I
once walked across the Mississippi, a mile wide, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the ice, from Wisconsin into Minnesota. There is
another thing ever to be remembered: while at
Philadelphia I was treated with a dish of <i>terrapine</i>,
a small sort of turtle, surpassing the gigantic species
in flavour to such a degree as to wholly eclipse its
merits. Why is it not imported? The very taste
of it would raise the feeblest palate from the dead!</p>

<p>It is nearly forty years since I saw the United
States: I have had plenty of time to think over
what I thought of them then. The enthusiastic
admirers of America are men who, being a little
eminent before going, receive an ovation on their
arrival. These men adore the worthy republicans,
write about them, mention their names in print in
the order in which they bestowed their attentions on
them. If these men who, being a little eminent,
went to ever-glorious France and received an ovation,
which they don’t, their enthusiasm would alike
tingle at the roots of their hair.</p>

<p>The Americans are nearly as good as older
states, perhaps better than some. As three hundred
years of civilization is, say, to six hundred, in that
proportion they are as good as Europeans.</p>

<p>But the greatness of America has to come. Time
will be when America, perhaps with Australian
lands, will be arbiter of the civilized world—if it
likes.</p>

<p>With some exceptions, if we take any one of
the United States, it will be found to be monotonous;
there is as much variety in an English county
as in any one of these.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>I compare the United States to a book: it is a
new and cheap edition of England in one volume;
price, one almighty dollar.</p>

<p>Altogether, there is no difference of moment
between the best English and the best Americans,
or the worst English and worst Americans.</p>

<p>Lawrence and Bancroft would have made good
dukes!</p>

<p>I remember dining with a great merchant at
Philadelphia, who told me that after receiving a
classical education at the University of Dublin, he
emigrated and became a clerk in an American house,
and that after a time he saw his way to establish a
business for himself, and had realized a large fortune.
He told me this that he might add the singular
assurance that he never once, in his almost lifelong
residence in America, had an opportunity of showing
how good his education had been, or of using a single
Latin word.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_51">LI.</h2>


<p>It was after the good Lord Ripon’s death, which
happened only too soon, that I went to Spring
Gardens to live, purposing to resume my medical
connection with the public, and to continue my
duties as physician at the West London Hospital,
to which I was attached. It then had not long
been instituted, but it is now an extensive and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
flourishing establishment in a populous suburb,
where it is much needed.</p>

<p>Mr. Cowell, a good and chivalrous benefactor
of the sick poor, now senior surgeon of the Westminster
Hospital, was resident surgeon of the West
London at that time; and Mr. Bird, who, in conjunction
with his father, was its founder, was one
of the surgical staff.</p>

<p>The Countess Dowager of Ripon spent the
season at Carlton Gardens, in the family mansion;
and, continuing my professional engagement, after
the earl’s death, to her, I had the pleasure of
visiting her daily.</p>

<p>Lady Ripon was a woman who deserved to be
remembered as long as the lives of the good and
great have an interest for mankind, and let us hope
that may be as long as the human race endures.
Her belief was as implicit in a happy future, as it
was in the morrow of every day; and she regulated
her actions accordingly, as inseparable from the
duties devolving on her responsible position.</p>

<p>There are many such women in every class
who, if they changed places, would remain the
same; but they have not an equal opportunity of
making it manifest how true they are. The
countess felt her position as the daughter and
the wife of an earl; it made her feel the more for
those whom circumstances made dependent on her.
She had been a great heiress, born to the inheritance
of Nocton and other estates, in Lincolnshire; and
she firmly regarded herself as appointed by Heaven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
or rather entrusted, to administer the large means
that belonged to her for the good of those who had
a claim on her for support.</p>

<p>When at Stutgard in 1833, during a wide continental
tour, not so commonly made in those days
as now, I became acquainted with Sir Edward Disbrowe,
the British minister, and the other members
of the embassy. These were Mr. Wellesley, the
eldest son of Lord Cowley, and Mr. Gordon, the
eldest son of Gordon, of Ellon Castle. At that
house I met Count Pozzo di Borgo, and a young
Buonaparte, who was a guest of the King of Wurtemburg.</p>

<p>Mr. Wellesley was quite a young man and very
sociable; Mr. Gordon was yet younger, and of very
engaging ways. Count Pozzo di Borgo was getting
on in life, but very upright, and, with his orders on,
made a brilliant show. He was perfectly free in
his conversation, and spoke on political matters
without any reserve. He remarked pretty plainly,
but with a playful <i>naïveté</i>, to the young Prince
Buonaparte, who was present, that if his advice
had been followed in the days of Elba, the battle
of Waterloo would not have been fought.</p>

<p>Some say how small the world is: certainly, in
its fortuitous concourse of live atoms. There is not
so much room but that many meet after long intervals
again. So, after a lapse of some thirty years,
the youthful Gordon, whom I knew so well as Sir
Edward Disbrowe’s <i>attaché</i>, then as much boy
as man, turns up again on a visit to Lady Ripon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
with a grisly beard, and a face that showed no
marks of having once been young. But this is
not all: on a similar visit appeared two young
ladies of fashion as daughters of Sir Edward Disbrowe.
They were either babes or not born at the
time when I knew their father so well.</p>

<p>The Gordons were cousins of Lady Ripon. A
Colonel Gordon, the brother of Gordon who was
soon to be Gordon of Ellon, was my particular
friend as long as he lived. He had retired from
active service on returning finally from India, but
his desire was to die in the army, though, by not
selling out, he was the loser by several thousand
pounds.</p>

<p>I would mention one lady in particular, who
consulted me while I was in Spring Gardens, because
she was the Queen of Beauty at Lord Eglinton’s
tournament, besides being the grand-daughter
of Sheridan, and the wife of the Duke of Somerset.
A beautiful youth, Lord Edward St. Maur, one
afternoon drove up to my house and asked me if
I would go with him to the Admiralty and see his
mother, the duchess. It was on a slight matter
affecting her daughter, and she afterwards asked
me to see her son, Lord St. Maur. All this was
easy work, but I was pleased at seeing another
grandchild of Sheridan, for I had known Mrs.
Norton over a quarter of a century before.</p>

<p>But the young man, Lord Edward, for him a
sad fate was in waiting; more sad than that which
later befel his elder brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>The sons of great houses have few means of
distinction, however ambitious, except in politics,
which many of them abhor. They are shut out
from the nobler professions. Lord Edward, a
young man of courage, sought excitement in the
jungles of India, and this ended in his being torn
to pieces by a tiger.</p>

<p>Having an acute mind, which at all times lay
parallel with truth, I was a good diagnostic of disease
(agnostics were then in their infancy), and I was
able to weigh a good many experiences under one
in the same balance. I made this remarkably evident
during the last illness of Lord Ripon, which was a
very costly one, for all the celebrities in Physic were
in attendance at Putney. Perhaps I took an unfair
advantage, for I was so absolutely independent in
my position that I could give an unbiassed opinion,
while the physicians and surgeons, under the influence
of expediency, agreed on a still favourable view
of the case. That such could happen is the fault
of the patient’s friends. If the physicians abandon
hope while there is life, others are uselessly called in.
After they left, with the assurance that the patient
was all right, Lord Goderich and Sir Charles Douglas,
who was a friend of the family, asked me to take a
turn with them in the grounds, wishing to hear my
opinion, which I frankly gave, to the effect that in a
fortnight the earl would no longer be living.</p>

<p>But I was wrong, too, in my way, for he lived
just seventeen days from that time.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_52">LII.</h2>


<p>While in Spring Gardens—this was in 1860—I
got together my researches on “The Bones in
Scrofula,” which Dr. Baly presented to the Medico-Chirurgical
Society, before which it was read, and
a very full abstract of it was published in their
“Proceedings,” and in all the medical journals of
the day.</p>

<p>Lord Goderich, a young man of great promise,
then member for one of the Yorkshire Ridings, succeeded
his father in the House of Lords, very unwillingly,
as he liked the Commons better, and he
humorously declared himself disfranchised. Three
months later his uncle, Earl de Grey, died, whose
title he took, and he then became sole owner of
Studley Royal, which before him belonged to the
two brothers.</p>

<p>Lord Goderich was married to a young lady
who, to save time, I may say was possessed of every
charm—animation, beauty, simplicity, humour, a
hearty ringing laugh—and these shaped themselves
into countless groups, all equally pleasing.</p>

<p>Now that I am unable to visit her, I have her
promise of seeing her yet again, from time to time,
and this alone is enough to keep me alive.</p>

<p>The present earl, now Marquis of Ripon, soon
became a useful public servant under Lord Palmerston,
as an under-secretary, first of the Local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Government Board, then of the India Office, and
rose ultimately to be Viceroy of India, by the
Queen’s express wish, her Majesty having known
him when he was a child, and the playmate of the
Prince of Wales. He has always been in sympathy
with the classes beneath him, and his strictly conscientious
character affords the clue to every action
of his life.</p>

<p>He is a descendant both of Hampden and Cromwell.
The head representative of the Cromwell
family was Mr. Field, in my time the apothecary to
Christ’s Hospital; the next is the Count of Palavicini,
of Genoa; and then comes the Marquis of
Ripon.</p>

<p>The Fields, I believe, are the same as those of
Ozokerit fame.</p>

<p>In London I frequented the laboratory of my
old friend, Dr. Marcet, at the Westminster Hospital,
where he was the chemical professor; and I attended
the meetings of the Chemical Society, which I belonged
to, and there met again Dr. Faraday, whose
lectures I had followed in early life. I had met
him, too, at Brighton, at a scientific meeting. He
was then asked to say something by way of an
address, which he did, but told us that he was so
accustomed to speak with apparatus in his hands,
that he found it difficult to say anything without it.
At that time I met Mr. Davies Gilbert. Seated by
him and talking with him on the advanced state of
knowledge, he remarked that all that was known
of the sciences in his early days was contained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Boyle’s Dictionary. This was at a dinner given to
the great geologist, Gideon Mantell.</p>

<p>During my visit to America, I read before a
medical society at Boston a paper “On Vital Force,
its Pulmonic Origin, and the General Laws of its
Metamorphosis.” It was founded on a lecture that
I delivered in 1853 at Bury, at the Young Men’s
Institution, of which I was the president. This
paper, which showed that carbon was the element
out of which this force arose during its combustion
at the lungs, was published in an American journal
in 1854, and republished in London. This I
mention because I was the first to take that view.
Mayer saw it later, and I think has all the credit
of it. I added to this republication some scientific
views of interest, especially one on the water of
organization.</p>

<p>While on these subjects I may as well mention
that, between the years 1839 and 1853, I contributed
largely to the medical press; my papers are noted
from time to time in the Directory of those years.
In one series that I gave to the Provincial Medical
and Surgical Journal of the Association, then edited
by Dr. Streeter, “A Critical Analysis of the Principal
Facts of Disease,” I showed by elaborate experiments
that the movement of the blood in the
capillary vessels was due to the spinal nerves, and
not to the great sympathetic.</p>

<p>In the same series I pointed out the importance
of taking the temperature of the body, internal and
external, in disease, and constructed tables for noting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the variations, and this at a time (about 1840 or
1841) when the thermometer had not come into use
in medical practice.</p>

<p>I would allude here to a physiological inquiry
made by me, and which occupied much of my time
for twenty years or more, on a grammatical subject,
that of the sequence of sound in speech, with the
laws of diphthongism and accent.</p>

<p>There is another work I would make a record
of, it is unpublished, “A New Cosmogony.”</p>

<p>Stray papers, published or unpublished, I need
hardly note, except one on Drapery, which sculptors
and artists would do well to study. It was published
not so very long ago in <i>Merry England</i>, a monthly
magazine.</p>

<p>I have already alluded to the resuscitation of my
work on Varicose Capillaries by the Pathological
Society; it had been in a state of suspended animation
for fifty-one years.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_53">LIII.</h2>


<p>Circumstances connected with the increasing
delicacy of Lady Ripon’s health brought me into
nearer relations with the family, and although I kept
up my own establishment, I lived much at Putney
Heath. I may say I was made a friend of by this
good lady, whom it was a pleasure to serve, and
was engaged by her often in matters pertaining to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
her private life. She liked me sometimes to visit
Nocton, her paternal home, and report to her of
people and things which, on account of her inability
to visit the place herself, were drifting from her,
though her interest in them was unbroken.</p>

<p>She was gifted with a very fine intellect: she
had been carefully trained in her childhood, and
given all the knowledge that is becoming in a
woman. She had a natural wit, and her conversation
was much to be desired, full of anecdotes on
past events in which she had taken part. When I
came to know her she lived retired, at the same time
exercising hospitality without limit towards many
pleasant guests. When she returned from Carlton
Gardens to Putney Heath for the winter, I found it
difficult to go to and fro from town, so I settled
down at Roehampton, which was near. Among
those who visited her were Sir Charles and Lady
Douglas and Mrs. Charles Lushington, sister of Sir
Stafford Northcote, all very old friends, and these
would be with her for the week or month together.
Lord and Lady de Grey, too, were, of course, much
with her.</p>

<p>At this time George Borrow, having sickened,
like myself, of the charm of country life, was living
in Hereford Square; so we met again and had
many dinners together, and as many pleasant walks;
these chiefly in Richmond Park, which my home
overlooked, being close to the Robinhood Gate.</p>

<p>While at Roehampton I accidentally made the
acquaintance of Dr. Robert Latham, the grammarian;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
not exactly a nice person to see much of,
though a good companion, and one overflowing with
every sort of knowledge.</p>

<p>While at Roehampton, too, it was that I called
on Rossetti. I saw him then for the first time, and
was received by him very warmly, so much so that
he accepted my invitation to dine with me the next
day, and many hours were passed in conversation of
the most exhilarating kind.</p>

<p>A generation before, Rossetti had written to me
regarding my “Valdarno, or the Ordeal of Art
Worship,” then appearing in <i>Ainsworth’s Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>Before that visit to him I had returned to Poetry,
my first and last love, having plenty of leisure, with
my imagination unemployed. Spending some weeks
at Nocton, where I went by Lady Ripon’s request,
to look over her beautiful estate and visit the tomb
of the late earl, I was often of a morning in the
ancient wood, revelling in it for hours, the ground
covered with hyacinths and lilies of the valley, the
stock doves pouring out their sweet notes from
every bough. It was there, to commemorate my
visit, that I committed to paper my pastoral poem
of “The Lily of the Valley,” which will take any
one who reads it into Nocton Wood.</p>

<p>“Old Souls” I wrote while staying in Lady
Ripon’s house at Putney: Mrs. Lushington and
her beautiful family of daughters were guests. One
Sunday, on returning from church with her to lunch,
the idea of that poem crossed my mind, impressed
by the finely dressed crowd that was chatting and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
laughing on the way to the fashionable villas in
Wimbledon Park.</p>

<p>These two poems were the beginning of a
volume named “The World’s Epitaph,” which was
printed anonymously and distributed at random
among friends and strangers, as well as editors of
the press, and apparently it attracted no sort of
notice, except from the librarian of a Cambridge
college, who said that he had made it his companion
during a pleasant tour.</p>

<p>I have forgotten the name of this gentleman,
and of his college, but I will one day try to recall
it. I must have distributed over a hundred copies.</p>

<p>One copy, sold at W. B. Scott’s sale, the words
“D. G. Rossetti, with the author’s compliments,”
written on the title-page, found its way into a bookseller’s,
who advertised it in his catalogue, price
eight shillings and sixpence. A relative of mine,
who called to see it, was informed that it had been
purchased for the library of the British Museum.</p>

<p>Evidently Rossetti had lent the volume to Scott;
in his keeping it shared the lot of so many borrowed
books, in being never returned.</p>

<p>A literary celebrity once pointed out to me four
hundred books on his shelves, all of which, he said,
had been borrowed.</p>

<p>Mr. Buxton Forman told me only the other day
(Nov. ’91), that he was one evening at Madox
Brown’s, when Rossetti entered in a state of excitement,
with the “World’s Epitaph” in his pocket,
which he produced, and did little but talk about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
“Old Souls.” It must have been the copy of which
I have spoken, dated 1866, a beautifully printed
little book from the press of Woodfall and Kinder.</p>

<p>Dr. R. Latham was good enough to send some
copies of the book to his friends, and they took it as
his in their reply, which he regarded as too good a
joke to disturb.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_54">LIV.</h2>


<p>Latham was a singular anomaly of our organization.
No one could help liking and disliking him.
He was logical in mind, illogical in action. As captain
of Eton College, he became a Fellow of King’s, and
before long was the greatest authority on English
grammar. He was Physician to the Middlesex
Hospital; he was Professor of the English Language
at University College. He dressed like a respectable
clergyman. Then, from being a great man,
he gradually became a little man, and dressed like
a clergyman of a less reputable type; his white
necktie unlaundressed, his fine chin ill-shaven, his
black coat unskilfully brushed, if at all; but his eye
and tongue continued in full practice for satire or
fun. Unable to finance in his own affairs, he thought
his true function in life would have been that of
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and that he had so
missed his mark. A common saying of his, with
an earnest look and his hand on a friend’s shoulder,
was, “Will you lend me a sovereign that you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
never see again?” An acquaintance of his, feeling
touched at his outward display of poverty, almost
amounting to boastfulness, inwardly gifted as he
was, on putting gold apologetically on his table,
received the reply: “I am glad you are in a position
to do it; what may your income be?” Another,
treating him similarly, heard a laugh, with the
words, “It is very nice to put your hand in your
waistcoat pocket and do that. What income tax
do you chance to pay?”</p>

<p>Nature ought not to put such organic prescriptions
through the process of being dispensed.</p>

<p>He was heir-presumptive to a fine landed
property, the reversion of which he sold for a sum
not larger than a year of its rental. The heir-apparent
died, and the estate fell in, never to reach
him. His wife said she thought it a pity to have
lost the property as he had done. He answered,
“But, my dear, you cannot say you have lost what
has never been yours!”</p>

<p>Like a good chancellor of the exchequer, he
had the habit of assessing people’s incomes at a
guess, for the purpose of determining what they
ought to give towards the subscriptions so constantly
on foot for his benefit.</p>

<p>Latham once made the effort to ask Mr. Gladstone
for a pension. The minister said that it was
a matter resting with Lord Palmerston, the premier,
who was very jealous of his rights, and advised the
applicant to state his claim in the proper quarter.</p>

<p>On this, Latham let the subject drop, when some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
time afterwards he received a notice that he was
placed on the civil list for £100 a year, and received,
according to custom, the amount in advance.</p>

<p>His difficulties occupied the attention of many,
and he was made more easy in his circumstance as
age overtook him; but on his pension being alluded
to, he related, as a joke, that he had sold that before
its first year had expired.</p>

<p>Latham had a very handsome person, with a
smiling, knowing look, the most knowing I ever saw.</p>

<p>He was decidedly of a kindly nature: fond of
his family, genial to excess, recognisant of his friends.
He was probably spoiled by falling into the worst
habits of college life, instead of the best.</p>

<p>Nothing that I have written would offend his
shade. He was proud intellectually, but he abandoned
position, and, I really believe, purposely
exhibited himself as poor, when he would walk
home with a cabbage balanced upon his arm. It
was meant as a reproach to the world, on which he
had so decided a claim.</p>

<p>One day Latham called on me and brought Mr.
Theodore Watts with him, an old friend of his, and
the son of a yet older friend. Watts and I came
into concord on the same octave, and we soon
attuned ourselves in friendly duets.</p>

<p>Later on, George Borrow turned up while Watts
was there, and we went through a pleasant trio, in
which Borrow, as was his wont, took the first fiddle.
The reader must not here take metaphor for music.
Borrow made himself very agreeable to Watts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
recited a fairy tale in the best style to him, and
liked him.</p>

<p>This was not their only meeting, for both came
often to my house, from which we strolled for an
hour or two into the park—strolls deserving of
remembrance, as shown in sonnet form by me in
my “New Day.”</p>

<p>Latham wanted much to meet Borrow at my
table; I told him it would not do. He said he
would be on his best behaviour, and promised to
say nothing that could offend the most sensitive.</p>

<p>I proposed it to Borrow; he was willing, and
they met.</p>

<p>All, like most things else that are planned,
began well. But with Latham life was a game of
show. He had to put forth all his knowledge of
subjects in which he deemed Borrow an adept. He
began with horse-racing. Borrow quietly assented.
He showed off all he knew of the ring. Borrow
freely responded. He had to show what he knew
of publishers, instancing the Longmans. Borrow
said, “I suppose you dine with your publishers
sometimes?” It was Latham’s opportunity; he
could not resist it, and replied, “Never; I hope I
should never do anything so low. You do not dine
with John Murray, I presume?” “Indeed, I do,”
said Borrow emotionally. “He is a most kind
friend. When I have had sickness in my house,
he has been unfailing in his goodness towards me.
There is no man I value more.”</p>

<p>Latham’s conversation was fast falling under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
influence of wine; with this his better taste departed
from him. “I have heard,” he said, “that you are
a brave man over a bottle of good wine. Now, how
many bottles can you get through at a sitting?”</p>

<p>Borrow saw what the other was; he was resolved
not to take offence at what was only impertinent
and self-asserting, so he said, “When I was in
Madrid, I knew a priest who would sit down alone
to his two bottles.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Latham, with his knowing look,
and his head on one side like a bird, “but what I
want to know is, how many bottles you can manage
at one sitting?”</p>

<p>“I once knew another priest,” said Borrow. “It
was at Oporto; I have seen him get through two
bottles by himself.”</p>

<p>By this time Latham was a little unsteady; he
slipped from his chair as if it had been an inclined
plane, and lay on the carpet, on which he made his
mark as betokening more than nausea. He was
unable to rise, but he held his head up, with a
cunning smile, saying, “This must be a very
disreputable house.”</p>

<p>Borrow saw Latham after this at times on his
way to me, and always stopped to say a kind word
to him, seeing his forlorn condition.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_55">LV.</h2>


<p>It must have been in 1871 that I made the
acquaintance of Rossetti. This was some time
after Lady Ripon’s death, on which I visited my
married daughter in Germany, but finally returned
to Roehampton. It was then that I called on the
poet-painter, as described. After dining with me,
he was so good as to send me a note, in which he
said he should like to ask some of his friends to
meet me at dinner. In reply, I said that it would
be a pleasure to me to dine with him, but begged
him not to inconvenience himself on my account, as
it would suit me at any time to visit him.</p>

<p>On the day finally fixed there were many at
dinner, and as many later. Many of these, at the
time, had good positions as editors, writers, and
painters. W. B. Scott was at the table, also Mr.
Sidney Colvin, Mr. Joseph Knight, Dr. Hüffer, Mr.
William Rossetti, and so on; and in the evening,
Dr. Westland Marston, Mr. O’Shaugnessy, Philip
Marston, Madox Brown, Dr. Appleton, a wife or
two, and not a few besides.</p>

<p>Some of these have increased in fame since then,
some are dead, some are forgotten. Madox Brown,
a painter with a fine historic imagination, flourishes
still.</p>

<p>Rossetti’s topic was still “Old Souls;” Scott
was his echo. They said it was a subject that
could never be written on again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>At this date Rossetti’s poems were passing
through the press, and I had a bundle of verse
myself ready for it.</p>

<p>I was very much moved by the contents of
Rossetti’s volume. I still admire it much, but with
a severer criticism than then.</p>

<p>I could say much of Rossetti’s later life, but
am compelled to omit all such details, for they are
intimately mixed up with illness, which to a physician
the witness of it, is sacred ground. Then again,
friends are bad biographers, because they know too
much and cannot shape the character to that ideal
which those personally unknown to a great poet
might expect.</p>

<p>Rossetti’s intellectual force was not of a striking
order, but it was adequate; his charm lay in the
artistic colouring of his mind, arrayed as it was in
the fascinations of a Provençal attire. This is very
different to the charm in which Nature invests her
lovers; and yet it is so bewitching as to claim a
rivalry, and to almost appear the subject of her inspirations
in some enchanted guise.</p>

<p>I had heard that paintings were leaving Cheyne
Walk, such as in colouring had not been seen since
Titian lived; and, with a claim on his acquaintance,
I was induced to visit him.</p>

<p>What Reynolds’s faded works once were we no
longer know, but when I saw Rossetti’s paintings
I was reminded of what was said of one—the Infant
Hercules, sent to Russia—that it looked as if it had
been boiled in brandy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a pleasure to me to think that I was once
a comfort to Rossetti in his trying illness. I went
to him on his summoning me to Scotland. I passed
six weeks with him there; first at Stobbs Hall,
afterwards outside Crieff, to which place, among
others, I travelled to find him a suitable abode. I
walked with him by day, I sat at his bedside by
night, relating to him the history of almost every
one I had ever known, and by diverting his mind
from itself, I left him comparatively restored.</p>

<p>If he forgot all this, it was no fault of his own
making; his illness never fully subsided. But I
was among the favoured still who had known him
in his best days, and was appointed to serve him
in his most trying hour.</p>

<p>I can further say that when I saw Rossetti in
his prime, a healthy man, he was the noblest of men,
and had a heart so good that I have never known
a better, seldom its equal.</p>

<p>Illness changed him, but then he was no longer
himself.</p>

<p>Taking Rossetti’s pictures and his verse together
as one, he was a great poet; his poetics and paintings
help each other, as did Blake’s in a vastly
inferior degree, but their separation shows faults in
each with distinctness. When one reads his poems,
one thinks of his paintings; when one looks at his
paintings, one thinks of his poems; whence the
charm that surrounds all his work.</p>

<p>The celebrity that awaited Rossetti’s poems
among critics was latent in his paintings, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
were already famous for their emotional colouring
and fine portraiture of women; and, being in intimate
social relation with many leading members
of the press, his poetical pretensions were accepted
by acclamation. Then he had a powerful <i>clientèle</i>
among buyers. Those who possessed his pictures
were very ready to receive and admire the poems
of their favourite artist, and to push them about in
the fashionable and the wealthy world, as the works
of the poet-painter, a title rarely obtained, so many
gifts does it imply.</p>

<p>It was this that at once secured him his deserved
success. He had published the “Blessed Damozel,”
one of the poems on which his reputation rests,
when a young man unknown to art, and it attracted
no attention in the world at large; for justice is not
done to merit of any kind unless it can pay its way.</p>

<p>The “Blessed Damozel” may be characterized
as a drawing with tender descriptions of convent
life, with the Virgin Mary as lady abbess; the whole
lifted into remotest space, where lies the boundary-line
of Heaven; the damozel being a sort of nun
living among the holy, while all her reflections are
human; the burden of them from first to last on
love for an absent one, without whose presence she
can find no happiness in her purgatorial heaven.
It reads like the suggestion of a picture done in
mediæval times—as old as the court cards in the
pack used by players—at a period when the
glory of saints and of christs was symbolized by a
sort of curtain-ring round the head, or by circular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
fireworks which emitted sparks in perpetual
corruscation.</p>

<p>I do not feel that the antique moulding of this
poem is a fair excuse for its being illogical in places.
The sun was so far off that it was scarcely visible—say
two billion miles or so, like Uranus or Neptune;
but that it looked like a bridge, is a simile that cannot
be made suggestive of any round body save the
moon. That she can see the earth spin like a fretful
midge, does not please the logical understanding,
when that body is at least as far off as the scarce-visible
sun. We are comparatively close to our neighbouring
orbs, Venus and Mars, which do not exhibit
the slightest motion to our eyes—how then
should a world as remote from the damozel as
Uranus is from us be seen in motion?</p>

<p>We are made to realize that the “Blessed Damozel”
is of flesh and blood; she stoops and bends
forward until her bosom makes the bar she leans
on warm. But the souls mounting up to God were
spirits; they passed by her like thin flame. This
does not show the logical consistency which poetry
demands even more rigidly than prose.</p>

<p>The poem is strictly sentimental. The one
feeling of love-longings runs through every stanza.</p>

<p>The subject was painted for Lord Mount
Temple. I have not seen the work, but doubtless
it is composed of the three first verses of the poem,
which must have been painted on the author’s mind
long before it reached the canvas. The poem,
which is not very musical or imaginative beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the <i>motif</i> it carries out, has a great charm for many.
It is simple in diction and emotional, and a merit
not often found in Rossetti’s love poetry is its
spiritual character, the lover not being near to
incite the girl to passion of the naked kind which
pervades his sonnets.</p>

<p>The author cannot be said to exhibit himself
personally in this poem, nor in the other with which
his fame is equally bound up, namely, “Sister Helen.”
Both appear to tell their own story, which is the
perfection of narrative, a truth which critics cannot
too forcibly insist on. It is no easy matter for a
writer himself to appear beautiful in the midst of
his beautiful verses, unless his subject and its treatment
is of the most elevated kind, as in Coleridge’s
“Love,” which is so deliciously pure, and in the
first verse or two of Wordsworth’s “Intimations.”</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_56">LVI.</h2>


<p>A subject overwrought, like the sermon of a
Calvin, must verge on the satanic. The poem of
“Sister Helen” escapes this only through the pangs
of hate being mollified in every verse by the despairing,
heart-broken utterance of a refrain addressed
to the Virgin Mother, and poured out in the agony
of a once-religious, still-believing, soul, wailing with
a bitterness which nothing can soften—an eternal
hatred of her seducer; nothing short of seeing him
in the flames of hell,—willing herself to suffer in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
them a torment that is only less than her thirst
of revenue.</p>

<p>That she should breathe forth all this in a
subdued voice of sorrow in the ear of the blessed
Mary Mother is almost too touching for perusal;
yet the pathos of the situation is even further
enhanced by the tender and sad replies she gives
to her innocent little brother, from whom she
struggles to conceal, almost vainly, the anguish of
her heart and its wicked aim. The refrains, for
the most part full, are not always equal to the
occasion, but might easily have been so rendered
by so feeling a writer.</p>

<p>Of course the time must come when the poetry
of England is melted down and merged into an
anthology, and it is probable that the “Sister Helen,”
as being the strongest emotional poem, as yet, in
the language, will be among the most lasting works,
and escape dissolution for a long time to come;
perhaps will survive all change. And here a very
remarkable fact thrusts itself before the mind; a
representative one, which is that if Rossetti had
written not another line besides this poem, his genius
would have appeared all the greater: for lesser
work is a fatal commentary on greater.</p>

<p>All suffer from this comparison with themselves
except Gray, who wrote so little; and even he, after
his Elegy, is scarcely saved the self-reproach.</p>

<p>Rossetti, in his writings, did not exercise much
imagination, and none of the philosophic kind, by
means of which the idea ascends, metaphor above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
metaphor, as high as the perspective of thought can
attain. He did not look to musical sonance in his
metre and his choice of words. He did not realize
that love, to be acceptable in verse to the higher
orders of mind, must be spiritual and chaste, that
when carnal we possess it only in common with the
beasts of the field. He could not have put on
canvas the scenery of his fifth sonnet for exhibition,
except in contravention of Lord Campbell’s Act.</p>

<p>From what I have read of his sonnets in his first
edition, the vehicle of expression which such composition
should formulate was beyond his reach.
Above all other forms it demands the philosophic
imagination, which scarcely any poet has enjoyed,
because its possessors revert to science, as being
within their compass, and as subject to higher
reward. In Rossetti’s sonnet the expression of the
thought rises no higher than its first statement, it
has no grand climacteric. His imagination, in fact,
was introspective rather than retrospective, and was
scarcely prospective at all.</p>

<p>Rossetti was a charming companion: he spoke
well and freely on all subjects, literary and artistic,
and with much knowledge of contemporary writings.
His studio was a favourite resort of men whose
names were on title pages, to whom he showed the
work he had in progress; and, to his intimate friends,
he would sometimes read a poem in a rich and
sonorous voice. He had a very just mind. When
an author was discussed, whatever might be said
against him, he would insist on his merits being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
remembered. From rivalship and its jealousies he
was absolutely free, and his hospitality was without
limit. Above all, he was ready at all times to serve
a friend, and to exert his influence to that end.</p>

<p>Interesting as Rossetti must always be to a large
section of society, I have not considered myself
justified in entering at any length on his domestic
life, intimately as at one time it was mixed up with
my own. Still, without impropriety, I may rest
lightly on it, in such manner as to contribute some
touches towards the picture of a man whose influence
on art will last longer than the canvas on which his
ideas are so brilliantly spread. I, therefore, propose
to myself the task of narrating my visits to him, in
Perthshire, and afterwards at Kelmscott, and at
Bognor.</p>

<p>One morning I visited him at Cheyne Walk,
when I saw that the restlessness of the past night
had pursued him into daytime. Qualifying his
request with an expression of great regard, he asked
me not to stay. His medical attendants were consulting
in another room: I joined them there, and
told them that my house at Roehampton was open
to Rossetti if they decided that he needed change.</p>

<p>On the same evening, in company with his
brother and Mr. Madox Brown, he came to
Roehampton, and I remember well his saying, as
he sat in my quiet drawing-room, that he was
enjoying what he had so long ceased to feel, and
that was peace. He sat up late in conversation
with his brother on various family matters, but his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
night was the most troubled one that he had hitherto
passed through. The next day he was visited by
his mother, and other members of his family, his
medical attendant from town preceding them. Miss
Rossetti, the gifted author of “The Shadow of
Dante,” and her brother, took a walk with me in
Richmond Park, while the mother remained with
her son.</p>

<p>Mr. Madox Brown joined us later, and the party
left the invalid in the evening.</p>

<p>But when the mind is restless, a sick man
imagines there is relief to be found in change, and,
after a few days, Rossetti returned to town, not to
his own house, but to that of Madox Brown, where
I saw him again, his restlessness unrelieved.</p>

<p>He had a good friend in Mr. Graham, the
member for Glasgow. That gentleman rented two
sporting seats in Perthshire, and he placed them at
the disposal of Rossetti, who then went to Scotland.
But he soon moved from one of these mansions to
Stobbs Castle, the other, a place belonging to Lady
Willouby de Eresby. While there he felt the want
of my assistance, and urgently requested that I
would leave without delay. I had a garden-party
for the next day from London; this I left to my
housekeeper and sons to conduct, and went by the
next train.</p>

<p>W. B. Scott and Madox Brown, two faithful
friends, were at the castle, ministering to their
brother artist. My son George, who had finished
his terms at Oxford, and had no present engagement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
was there too, and I found all so far satisfactory
that Rossetti was contented, enjoying the
quiet which was not to be found in his own home.</p>

<p>Stobbs Hall is an ancient inheritance of the
Drummonds, a solitude on the heights over-reaching
the Tay, with a parapet wall and a Dutch garden,
in which is a sundial erected on masonry, which
might have been there before the invention of
clocks. Below and to the right is a fine reach of
the river; on the opposite side is a vast plain of
cornfield, planted at intervals, and stretching on
northwards to the forest and Grampian hills. On
that side, the lords Mansfield enjoy the salmon
fisheries; their lands extending eastward to Scone
Palace. The two families take it by turns to fish
both sides of the river.</p>

<p>Any one wishing to read an account of this
scenery in poetic form, can turn to a sonnet called
“Rest,” in “New Symbols.”</p>

<p>Scott and Brown soon left the castle, a place
with not too much furnished accommodation. Over
the mantelpiece, in the one sitting-room, hung a
framed set of verses by Drummond, the Scotch
poet.</p>

<p>It was not very long before Rossetti’s occupation
of the place came to a close. He was fast improving
in health; he took long walks, but without
any enjoyment of the scenery which was made
romantic by water-fall and splashed leaves, ever
fresh, the elastic boughs bending under the weight
of a torrent. So far recovered, he desired to remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
in Perthshire, but still craved for the utmost solitude.
In search of such a home I took the train to Perth,
visited St. Andrews, returned to Perth, and proceeded
to Crieff, where I remained for some days
and scoured the environs. At last it occurred to
me to call on the leading practitioner, Dr. Gairdner,
and was directed by him to a farm-house two or
three miles from the town, on the river side. The
house had every requirement, and was kept by a
lady-farmer, whose manner and person had every
agreeable trait. On this, I telegraphed to Rossetti
and my son to follow me at once to Crieff, and at
the right time I met them at the station there, and
we drove to the new home.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant spot, with a walk into Crieff
by the river-side, down to a wilderness of waters.
There was plenty of mountain scenery in view, with
pine forest to the summits, and lake not remote;
not to forget the sky-threading mists and the
abundance of water from above. Descriptive of
this aspect is my sonnet called “Unrest.” Rossetti
rapidly improved in health, stumping his way over
long areas of path and road, with his thick stick in
hand, but holding no intercourse with Nature. It
was not long before he summoned his assistant,
with the implements of his art, and he was once
more happy.</p>

<p>At this time he made a chalk drawing of me,
and one of my son.</p>

<p>The first of these was reproduced in a volume
of sonnets, called by me, “The New Day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>The portrait of George was somewhat peculiar;
the neck was outstretched, and the expression was
heightened by the face being free of hair, which
elicited from Latham one of his quaint remarks.
He gazed at it for some time with his head like
a connoisseur’s on one side; then said, “Yes, a
South American slave-driver, who had returned to
Portugal to be shaved.”</p>

<p>There are very few male portraits by Rossetti:
the only three others are one of Mr. Stillman; one
of a youth, in his large picture of Dante’s Dream;
and one of Theodore Watts, which is a very good
one, but more vivacious than the original, and
there is more of the military air than was ever
assumed by that peaceful citizen, which makes him
look at least a lieutenant-colonel.</p>

<p>As a domestic trait, I would mention that
Rossetti was very hearty at all times over his
meals. He would wear out three knives and forks
to my one; and to me, whose breakfast seldom
exceeded one cup of coffee, his plate of bacon,
surrounded by eggs that overlapped the rim, was
amazing. I may further truly say that he, not
being a believer in physiological things, did not
regard tea as possessing the attributes of Totality.</p>

<p>While at this farm residence, he read with great
eagerness and delight the newly published life of
Edmund Kean.</p>

<p>By a careful treatment of him I procured him
good nights, effecting this object chiefly by remaining
at his bedside and draining my memory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
every anecdote I had ever heard, and relating to
him every amusing incident that I had encountered
during life in my intercourse with the world.</p>

<p>Finding him so well recovered, I left him in the
hands of his assistant and of my son, after an
absence of many weeks.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the year—it was 1872—Rossetti,
with my son, left Scotland and proceeded
to Kelmscott Manorhouse, which he tenanted with
his friend Mr. Morris. I visited him there, and
found him in good health and spirits, after a journey
spent, as I heard, with great joviality, the travellers
taking a third-class carriage to themselves. He was
already settled down to his art in a pleasant studio,
loving to talk while he painted; at other times deep
in the works of Dumas. In the afternoon he took
vigorous walks in the meadows which one after
another stretch out in front of the mansion.</p>

<p>The next day we went over the house and
grounds. It is an old place, with its seven or
rather twelve gables—such a sample of antiquity
as you don’t meet with often. The windows are
square casements with stone mullions, and the walls
very thick. The garden has its yew-tree hedges,
cut into fantastic shapes. The river is flooded
like a lake, so that old Thames don’t know itself
again. It is a most primitive village that surrounds
the place—a few scattered free-stone habitations,
some ivy-covered. There are no neighbours to
interfere with the liberty of the subject.</p>

<p>George was a good boatman, and he often rowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
me up the river, which half-way was spanned by
an elegant arched bridge, and bounded further on
by a weir. The scenery was very satisfying: on
the left bank one overlooked a gay meadow, the
cattle crowding to the bank to stare us out of sight;
on the other side were lofty trees, while in midstream
we had often to cut our way through islands
of weed. The memory of this and of a later visit
to the place was embodied in a poem, which I
called “Reminiscence,” in which the scenery lives.</p>

<p>I found opportunities of talking with Rossetti
about Mr. Theodore Watts, whose acquaintance I
wished him to make more fully, for I had already
introduced them to each other. While leading a
country life Watts had not only acquired a knowledge
of books, but had written poetry, and had
thought out many literary problems for himself.</p>

<p>The Manorhouse was adequately furnished,
but some exquisite chalk drawings, one especially,
of female heads, gave it a charm. I thought that
no one ever could paint a woman’s eyes like Rossetti.
There was a softness, a delicacy, a life, a
soul in them, never seen elsewhere but in living
beings, and that how rarely!</p>

<p>Rossetti was unwilling to separate himself from
George, and I consented to his retaining him as his
secretary, for such a one was very necessary to him
at that time.</p>

<p>I saw Mr. Morris at Kelmscott, and afterwards
in society; he was inscrutable then, and has since
been inscrutability in his career. W. B. Scott was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
also there, and when I left it was with him. Like
his countrymen, he practised an exemplary carefulness
in money matters, a habit which makes every
Scotchman well off. In the train he counted his
money with the dry remark, “One does not save
anything by making a visit to a friend!”</p>

<p>A letter from my son George, dated December
19, 1875, written at Aldwich Lodge, Bognor,
begins by a rejoicing to hear that I had accepted
Rossetti’s invitation to spend Christmas with him
at the seaside.</p>

<p>I sometimes look at the bottom of an antique
silver snuff-box, a reservoir more than two hundred
years old, the lid of elephant’s tooth, and I read—</p>

<p class="center">“T. G. H.,<br />
from<br />
D. G. R.,<br />
1875.”</p>

<p class="noindent">A memorial to me of better things than an old-fashioned
Christmas gathering.</p>

<p>And I use this snuff-reservoir every day; it
affords me nasal recreation.</p>

<p>Snuff-taking did not go out with the pigtails,
but it is on the wane; it has given way to smoking:
and diminished is the number of gifts, such graceful
objects for monarchs to present to men like myself—if
they did but know me!—of platinum or golden
boxes set in diamonds. And would you know the
reason of my persistence in taking snuff? It not
only wakes up that torpor so prevalent between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the nose and the brain, making the wings of an
idea uncurl like those of a new-born butterfly,
but while others sneeze, and run at the eyes and
nose, my schneiderian membrane is impervious to
weather, or, to be explicit, I never take cold in my
head.</p>

<p>Bath was my tarrying-place when Rossetti’s
invitation came to me, and I went to Bognor. The
great poet-painter occupied a commodious villa and
grounds in a lane, west of the town, and near to the
roughest bit of beach on the Sussex coast.</p>

<p>Rossetti had packed his house. Mrs. Rossetti,
the mother; Miss Maria and Miss Christina, the
sisters; Misses Polidori, who were the aunts; and
Watts, who was the friend, were there, together
with my sons, Edmund and Henry, for the festive
week. The villa had good rooms; upstairs was a
gallery with bedchambers on both sides, and ending
in a large apartment which became a studio. There
Rossetti worked, and liked to be read to while he
improved his canvas, till the afternoon, when he
took a violent walk over the boulders by the sea,
towards Selsey Bay, among the ruined wooden
groynes which had become seaweed gardens,
hideous of aspect, as if invented and laid out by
fish made man.</p>

<p>I walked with Rossetti daily over this penal
shore, reflecting on absent pleasure, he unconscious
of present pain. He talked but little while his feet
crunched the boulders, and took no heed of the
aspects of the scene, but seemed to be stamping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
health out of what was left unused for the six days’
creation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rossetti was a sweet lady, and Christina,
who still lives, a higher poet than her brother, is of
the noblest brand. The family, one and all, are
almost purely Italian. The father, a poet, was a
Neapolitan; the mother was a Tuscan, with some
Scotch blood. Rossetti may be regarded, not as
English, but as one of those powerful leavens with
which the genius of one country sometimes ferments
that of another, to give it a new vitality.</p>

<p>Watts, who was now on terms of brotherly
intimacy with him, bore him through any passing
difficulties that needed only better guidance than
his own.</p>

<p>That holiday was made cheerful, less perhaps by
the host himself than by his guests. In truth, I saw
regretfully that Rossetti was much unstrung; as
so many do, even when in health, he got tired of
his visitors, and ere long the party dispersed.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_57">LVII.</h2>


<p>Circumstances brought me into intimate association
with Mr. Noble, a most excellent and useful
sculptor. He was employed in producing a recumbent
statue of Lord Ripon. This memorial
figure was placed in Nocton church, the more
welcome there since the structure, a design of
Gilbert Scott, was due to Lady Ripon’s bounty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
He also made a fine bust of the deceased earl, all
of which work was done by order of his devoted
countess, whose name and the date of whose death
are inscribed on the tomb beneath his.</p>

<p>During the lifetime of the good Lady Ripon, I
spent several weeks from year to year during the
summer at Nocton Hall, by her wish, having some
of my family with me, and, on one occasion, the boy
Lord Goderich. During these visits I looked well
over the estate and reported my observations, or
any suggestions for changes, with Lord de Grey’s
approval.</p>

<p>The climate of the eastern country, from my
experience in East Anglia, and later in Lincolnshire,
I pronounce the best in England during the
warm season, when the air is well “cooked” by the
sun. I once wrote to Lady Ripon from Nocton,
that it was as if cod-liver oil was floating in the air.
But I must say that in the early months of the year,
when the east wind is “raw,” the climate is not fit
for a pet dog.</p>

<p>This very summer of ’91, when rain has turned
all our houses in the south and west into arks, and
ourselves into Noahs, I have said to friends, some
going to the Isle of Wight, others still farther into
the wet lands towards the Atlantic, “Go eastward
as far as you can away from the rain; go to Aldeburgh;
go to Cromer; go to Lowestoft; go to
Mablesthorpe, where wind and rain part company
before reaching so far.” They abided by my advice;
and while the millions on the west side were soaked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
through, those on the east had not a wet day once
a week, and, departing in sickly condition, came back
in health too good to last!</p>

<p>Ask the people on the west and on the east of
Scotland what sort of weather they have had in any
summer. When I was in Perthshire for six weeks,
it rained pretty well every day; and as I left by the
train I saw the September harvest between Crieff
and Perth cut and afloat on the meadows.</p>

<p>A fearful loss of oats! I had a friend that very
same season living on the coast of Fifeshire. It
was a lady. She informed me that all was sunshine,
scarce a drop of rain, during the period I
speak of.</p>

<p>Why should Egypt be said to monopolize all the
dry weather!</p>

<p>“Madeline and other Poems” appeared not long
after Rossetti’s volume. I kept myself clear of all
models and other modes of thought—a fact recognized
by every writer that reviewed my book. Rossetti
was the first to say this, which he did in the
Academy, the generosity of which proceeding
cannot be too strongly put forward when one
recollects that his own poems were in the hands
of the critics at the same time. He read the poem
before publication, and from what he wrote to me
I learned that the metre itself in “Madeline” had a
great charm for him.</p>

<p>I became known to Theodore Watts about the
time “Madeline” came out. He was then comparatively
young, and had formed for himself, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
country, certain poetic tenets which twenty years of
experience have since greatly enlarged. He did not
then think that “Madeline” had the elements of
success within it. In intellect, in isolated quotable
passages, according to his view, it abounded; for
the rest it came strange to him.</p>

<p>Twenty years of experience and change of
feeling affects us all; we become <i>blasé</i> for better
or worse; authors in whom we revelled go stale;
others, that we found it hard to bite at, seem to yield
a light that was but a spark before. The change is
in ourselves.</p>

<p>Not many months ago, after the publication of
“The New Day,” Watts was with me, and said,
“I have been reading ‘Madeline’ again; for sheer
originality, both of conception and of treatment, I
consider that it stands alone.”</p>

<p>I do not intend to submit this sentence to him
for further consideration; it was once in his mouth,
and thence it issued!</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_58">LVIII.</h2>


<p>I may tell the origin of “Madeline” in a brief
sentence. I had framed and delivered a lecture,
scientifically treated, on “Sleep, Dreams, Sleep-walking,
Sleep-talking and the Mesmeric State,”
which last I explained by the facts of hypnotism.
It was many years after this that I conceived the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
idea of conducting a character, in metre, through
all these states of the human soul, and “Madeline”
became that character.</p>

<p>Dr. Marston said, and I think truly, that the
poem had too much machinery—a mistake which I
have now corrected by erasure, in case an edition of
the work should ever be required.</p>

<p>Watts is a man of many rich endowments; he
has a fine poetic faculty, logical, yet warm; with an
imagination not introspective only, but one that
ranges over nature, and which might be called
circumspective. His sonnets will bear the analysis
to which I have submitted Shakespeare, Coleridge,
and Wordsworth, in a previous page.</p>

<p>Watts is now one of our most esteemed critics.</p>

<p>I had a close acquaintance with Harrison
Ainsworth among novelistic editors; he tried to
obtain for me the separate publication of “Valdarno,”
and, failing, wrote me his confident belief that it
must be resuscitated one day.</p>

<p>Ainsworth was a manly and handsome-looking
person. His romances gave great pleasure to the
readers of his time, which showed how willing
people are to live others’ lives without the penalties,
though they would very firmly decline living their
own over again, without the experience they had
too late acquired.</p>

<p>I suppose, in reading every novel, one tastes of
all the vices and virtues that have ever been
indulged in. One likes to be great and generous
vicariously; one even enjoys the sufferings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
wicked at second hand, and to commit even murder
on the like terms.</p>

<p>We have all the character, in <i>substrata</i>, not only
of the savage, but of the wild beast, of the vulture,
of the shark, of the boa constrictor, of the clawed
crab, of the animalcule itself. Some feel this, some
are wholly unconscious of it until it is accidentally
roused, some possess it only in a state of inanimate
suppression.</p>

<p>A novel founded on vulture life would have a
great run. It should dwell on the domestic virtues
of the bird, and show how it held an appointment
under Providence to follow in the wake of armies.</p>

<p>One of the finest novels I have read of late years
is that of Mr. Eden, entitled “George Donnington,”
a work replete with experiences, sympathetic in character,
in purpose wise; less a fiction than a narrative
of true Russian life, and written with as firm a hand
as was ever trained for literary success.</p>

<p>Though I could wish to have done with the
“strange eventful history” of a life, thus lived over
again, I must not rush on too fast, but must revert
to “Parables and Tales.”</p>

<p>The publisher of “Madeline” asked me to add
four more poems to “Old Souls,” and the three others
of the same metre, for an illustrated work; accordingly,
I gave him “Mother and Child,” “The Blind
Boy,” “The Cripple,” and “Old Morality.”</p>

<p>One morning at Cheyne Walk I read “The
Cripple” to Rossetti and Hüffer, and saw them both
in tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>I had written “The Blind Boy” before the new
volume was contemplated, and I sent it to Rossetti.
In answer he wrote to me, saying that he was on
the point of going out when it reached him, but that
he stayed in to read it, and was so impressed on
doing so, that he at once sat down and wrote to Mr.
John Morley, advising its insertion in the <i>Fortnightly
Review</i>. But Morley had recently printed in that
vehicle a long poem of W. B. Scott’s, and had
thereupon resolved never to admit again another
verse of any author whatsoever.</p>

<p>When “Parables and Tales” appeared Rossetti
selected the <i>Fortnightly</i> for his review of the new
volume. He never wrote any reviews except of my
poems. All the notices I ever received of my
writings were by strangers, except those kindly
given of them by Rossetti and his brother: that is
all I owe to friendship.</p>

<p>At this time I was personally free from professional
engagements. Lady Ripon was no more,
greatly to my sorrow, so I went for a few weeks to
Bath.</p>

<p>It was a great pleasure to me when staying in
that beautiful and healthful city to visit the grave of
Beckford, the wonderful author of “Vatec.”</p>

<p>The cemetery and tomb of Beckford would have
been a scene for Volney, though it is not a ruin,
unless it be regarded as one of human vanity.
“Vatec” is monument enough without a sarcophagus
of polished porphyry, and a tower lined with the
same costly stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>A medical friend of Mr. Beckford’s told me some
curious details respecting that gentleman’s will. He
had sunk his remaining property in an annuity, with
the exception of a unique collection of pictures and
statues valued at £100,000, destined for Hamilton
Palace, his daughter’s home. The result is one of
many instances which show how little influence the
dead exercise over the living.</p>

<p>There was an insuperable difficulty in the dead
being buried in his own beautiful cemetery, which
was unconsecrated ground, so the heir, the then
Duke of Hamilton, had the sarcophagus deposited
in the cemetery on the opposite side of the river.
The grounds of the one laid out with so much loving
care by the deceased, with their tower and exquisitely
carved gateway and their finely wrought
palings, the porphyry of the tower alone having been
brought from Egypt at an expense of £50,000, were
sold for £1500, and were about to be converted
into a tea-garden for the Lansdown races held
hard by.</p>

<p>These preliminaries got through, of course by
the duke’s agents, preparations were made for the
removal of the pictures and sculptures, but the
executors of the will stepped in, and announced that
those treasures were not to be given up until Mr.
Beckford’s cemetery held his remains.</p>

<p>This was a cruel dilemma, for the property had
to be repurchased at an enormous advance on the
price paid; but it was done, and the terms of the
bishop to consecrate the soil, previously declined,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
were acceded to. These were that the cemetery
should become the property of the Church!</p>

<p>The game was thus cleverly won and profitably;
the cemetery is fashionable, people pay high prices
for being buried in such good company. Every one
visits Beckford’s tomb, and the Church, in acquiring
the freehold, will be thought by many to have done
well for religion. But my mind is of a perverse
nature, and is apt to wander. It sometimes comes
across the word “infernal,” in relation to things on
high, and is sometimes arrested, as by an erratic
block, by the word “humbug,” but it would not like
to see the two words in juxtaposition in reference to
Church doings.</p>

<p>Beckford had desired that his sarcophagus should
be placed on the summit of his tower, whence, should
he open his eyes again, and be able to see through
porphyry, he would behold Fonthill Abbey.</p>

<p>But this pleasure was denied him, and he only
lies above the grass instead of below.</p>

<p>On the tomb one reads—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent7">“Eternal Power,</div>
<div class="verse">Grant me through obvious clouds one transient glimpse</div>
<div class="verse">Of thy bright presence in my dying hour.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After some weeks at Bath I went to Germany,
staying with my daughter, Mrs. Dupré, at Stassfurt,
where, underground, had been achieved one of
Nature’s most wonderful geological operations. A tidal
sea, once extending over many hundred square miles
of Prussian Saxony, was gradually blocked out from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
its connection with the Baltic, and had evaporated,
depositing its salts in the order of their solubility, but
still replenished at high tide through countless ages,
until at last, cut off from its connection with the
main waters, it dried up, and during other countless
ages became covered two hundred feet deep with
soil. The first deposit in this vast bed of salts was
common salt (chloride of sodium), a deposit so thick
that it has been drilled to a depth of one thousand
feet, and not yet pierced through. On the surface
of this deposit is found a considerable bed of chloride
of potash, with boracic salts, bromides, and others
of great commercial value.</p>

<p>Stassfurt is an ancient village some twenty miles
from Magdeburg. It has a fine old church, unwittingly
founded on a rock of salt, or at least above
one; not the same thing as a rock, for the miners
have been under the church’s foundations, and the
earth has quaked and the walls have been split and
shaken, almost to falling. The stork has built its
nest upon its tower from time immemorial, and is
the sacred bird of Stassfurt.</p>

<p>And that vast salt bed, now a mine whose streets
reach for miles under the town and country! By
torchlight it glitters with reflected flame, surpassing
in brilliancy all fairy land! There lies a dead sea,
with salt enough to supply the world for ever.</p>

<p>Thirty or forty lofty chimneys are erected over
it, and are, as new monuments, strangely marking
the spot where a sea had laid buried for ages unknown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>This is in Prussian Saxony, whence came our
invaders in the olden time. There is to be seen an
old Saxon church in a village just outside the town;
one descends into it by steps. A dust of ages,
vagrant as the wind, but which loves to take shelter
against walls, and to bury them as time goes on, has
settled itself for the time to come. Churches exactly
like this church are to be seen on the hills of Bath,
with their Saxon tower. Inside it are the high pews
and the gallery, at one end of which, on the right,
near the pulpit, is the pew of the squire. It is old
England before it migrated to our shores.</p>

<p>Thus our ancestors brought their institutions
here; so we in turn take them with us to newer lands.</p>

<p>My son-in-law was Professor of Chemistry at
the Westminster, in succession to the gifted Dr.
Marcet, whose assistant he had been for some years.
He resigned his place, and his brother Augustus
Dupré was elected in his stead, while he went to
Stassfurt to do chemistry on a larger scale, extricating
tens of thousands of tons of potash from its
chlorine. He was then the father of a baby, he has
now two grown-up daughters and three grown-up
sons.</p>

<p>I stayed several weeks at Stassfurt. My son
Cecil was there under Dupré. He had been a student
at the Westminster laboratory; he is now Chief
Inspector of Explosives at Melbourne in Victoria.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_59">LIX.</h2>


<p>My daughter was very happy in her domestic life
in Stassfurt. She was married from Lady Ripon’s
house on Putney Heath, where a grand breakfast
was provided for a large party of friends. Lady
de Grey, Lord Goderich, Colonel Bertie Gordon,
Mr. and Mrs. Dupré, my sons, George, Egmont and
Henry, Mr. and Mrs. William Hake (my brother
and his wife) and other members of my family and
friends, with myself, were there, the good countess
presiding with her usual kindness and grace.</p>

<p>The tables were hung round with festoons of
grapes, beneath which the guests were seated.</p>

<p>Every one was struck by the likeness of Mr.
Dupré to Bonaparte without any knowledge of the
reason, which was that they had a common ancestor
in the female line of Feisch, mother of the cardinal
of that name. When Mr. Dupré was page to the
King of Wurtemberg, Jerome Bonaparte, through
this connection, the guard often presented arms
as he passed, mistaking him for one of the royal
house.</p>

<p>He belonged to an old French family, that of
Dupré de St. Maur, with the rank of marquis, a title
never entirely dropped, and to which my son-in-law
now stands next in succession, though he may never
use it.</p>

<p>There was once an event of moment to the
Protestants of France, the revocation of the Edict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
of Nantes: this drove my son’s branch of the
Duprés into Germany and another to England,
whose descendants are settled in Buckinghamshire.</p>

<p>I went with all my family to the Harz, a mountain
which is like a large purse full of uncoined
money; it is said to contain every metal. Men
whistle when they have nothing better to do, and
they puff out their cheeks when they are hot. This
they are taught by Nature: she whistles and behold
a Vesuvius in full blast; she puffs out her cheeks
and behold the Harz mountains.</p>

<p>In England no place is more than 100 miles
from the sea; but except a strip of the Baltic all the
salt water of Germany is inland, and where its
waves spout out, the people have towns, which,
like our horse-troughs, are called Watering Places.
In Germany those who can afford the luxury of
gradual suicide, caused by over-good drinking and
eating, go there yearly to settle accounts with their
system.</p>

<p>These towns have their pilgrims from many
lands, who go as to Æsculapian Temples to repent
of their Hoch: but their sins are very curious;
they break out all over and all inside their bodies.
There are reddish and purple sins; these do penance
sometimes on the nose, sometimes on the large toes,
and other joints; sometimes they blossom all over
the skin. Then there are sins of the stomachic,
hepatic, renal, and pulmonic kind, each symbolizing
local contrition; and the penitents, with their sins
thus upon them, go every season to drink of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
holy waters, and some of them, for a time, are
forgiven.</p>

<p>Midway between Stassfurt and Magdeburg there
is a sort of park, called Schönebeck, where people
go for an idle day. It is bounded by a noted salt-water
evaporator which is a wall a mile long. There
is an hotel, and stalls for the sale of ephemeral
goods, as books, toys, and drinks, and a band plays
all day the music of the best composers. George,
who went with me by way of Hamburg, returned with
me to England by way of Cologne and Brussels.</p>

<p>My Roehampton days were now over. After
a stay in London, Brighton, and elsewhere, I went
to Bath early in 1873, and spent the August of that
year at Dover in company with my son Egmont;
I then went to Paris, where my eldest son, Thomas
St. Edmund, joined me, making the very naïve
remark during our walks, that one learns a good
deal of French out of doors. This I capped by
saying that English, too, might be learnt on the
shop-windows; but it was broken English, for the
gold letters stuck on the glass, of “English spoken
here,” often got loose, while some were missing.
My next movement was through the Cenis Tunnel
to Turin, where I met my youngest son, Henry,
who was a student of chemistry at the University of
Giesen, under Dr. Will.</p>

<p>After some stay at Turin we visited Genoa;
passing the month of November there, during
which I was bitten by mosquitos over the face in
a manner expressive of small-pox.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_60">LX.</h2>


<p>The most pleasurable recollection of this period
was a day spent at Nervi, ten miles from Genoa on
the <i>Riviera Levante</i>.</p>

<p>The lovely bay of Nervi, on a sunny day, is
enriched with every colour: the steep shores of
black, veined with white, a magnesian limestone,
worn by the waves into waves; the blue waters
breaking over projecting rocks, curdling into white,
while pools of foamy green fill the basins. It was
here that I collected my colours and ideas for
“The Painter” in “New Symbols,” which I wrote
on returning to Genoa, a place not so attractive
as some Italian cities, though the Palazzo Rosso,
with its art collection, is never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>There is no sea coast worth visiting at Genoa,
scarcely a bathing place; all occupied and spoilt
by fortifications. Nevertheless we wandered among
the vineyards and villas, our eyes doing honour to
the one that had belonged to Paganini.</p>

<p>On a descending road we walked along a
festooned vineyard, regarding the ripe fruit with
longing eyes, for it was sultry weather, and our
great contribution to it was thirst. At the bottom
of the hill was a fruiterer’s shop, where a barrowful
of grapes had just arrived, and we gained permission
to eat. Our thirst was slaked and we
asked what we owed in payment; it was a few
coppers, and we took from our pockets at random,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
a good half-dozen times the amount demanded.
For such small pay, we witnessed a rapture such
as no stage exhibits.</p>

<p>On reaching the streets of the city we encountered
a crowd, in the midst of which two men, a large and
a small one, were wrestling in an agony of rage.
The big man suddenly wrested a knife from the
hand of the little one, and flung it far from him,
pointing at it in triumphant scorn.</p>

<p>The little man, all over in a fury that actor never
attained to, rushed to his house close by, imploring
his wife, who was at the door, to give him another
knife; but she refused, so the fight was over.</p>

<p>We have not forgotten the Via Nuova, that
narrow street of palaces of which our Pall Mall is
a resemblance; and we have not forgotten the
statue of Columbus,—it was nearly opposite our
hotel.</p>

<p>More of Genoa I do not care to note, except
that the villas of various colours, red, blue, green,
and yellow, surrounding it, look suited to the climate;
that of Novello more picturesque than the shop in
London where he gathered together all his money.</p>

<p>Henry toiled up the hill to inspect the cemetery.</p>

<p>It is a saying, rife at Genoa, that it takes three
Jews to cheat one Genoese. The inhabitants are,
certainly, a very business-like people.</p>

<p>The remembrance comes up in my mind that
the cactus grows wild here on the old crumbling
walls; as the houseleek does on our tiles.</p>

<p>We crossed the mountain that separates Genoa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
and Spezia—a picturesque journey, with frequent
sea-views. The only conveyance was by Diligence,
and there is danger; the driving becoming furious
as soon as the descent into Spezia begins; nevertheless,
we entered the town in safety.</p>

<p>Spezia has its charm; the old streets at the back,
the new ones in front near the sea, the temple of
Venus on the hill to the right of the shore, Lerici
on the left, where Shelley died. But those marble
hills that surround the place! As the sun sets,
they and the sea become of one pink colour; as the
sun sinks deeper, the brilliance quits the water,
except where the little waves rise and just dip their
crests into it once more.</p>

<p>We took the train to Florence, Henry getting
out at Pisa to join me again.</p>

<p>I had returned to Florence after over forty
years. Not a soul that I formerly knew was there;
all had vanished, lost in the crowd of the absent or
dead.</p>

<p>I felt like the last man! But I met with new
friends there; the truest of all, Madame Mazzini,
was almost the first of these. During my forty
years’ absence she had been born, had married, and
become a mother, and then a widow, afterwards to
become the wife of an illustrious Italian, Signor
Villari, senator, and now, in ’91, a member of the
Government, as Minister of Education.</p>

<p>She, like her husband, a distinguished author,
has been my sincere friend for twenty years.</p>

<p>There was nothing to take me to Florence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
nothing but a longing that time could not extinguish,
a longing to see again its palaces, its churches, its
Palazzo Vecchio in its over-powering might of
grandeur embossing architecture on the sky; the
Palazzo Strozzi, so defiant of all that is plebeian;
the Casa Ricarsoli, so graceful as almost to say a
house may be of the fairer sex! The Duomo, the
Campanile, not yet under a glass case, as Michael
Angelo said playfully, it was worthy to be; and the
Sacristy at its side. These and more I longed to
see again, with a passion that impels the wanderer
to return to his native land. And those delicious
walks to Fiesole and Bellosguardo, whence, from
summits, one gazes on Florence as on an enchanted
city!</p>

<p>Then the Tuscans, with their bright intellects
and fine faces, from prince to peasant; their gentleness
towards the stranger; their melodious, grammatical
enunciation of the one sweet language
perfected in the course of ages out of the beautiful
words handed down from Greece and Rome.</p>

<p>I had thus reached Florence by Mont Cenis,
Turin, Alexandria, and Pisa. At Genoa I inquired
of a peasant my way; he took me to the place I
wanted, a steep ascent. I offered him a gratuity,
which he refused, saying, “The signor is a stranger!”
Forty years before, one dark night, I asked a Prince
Corsini, not knowing whom he was, to direct me to
the Via Maggio where I lived. He turned out of
his path and escorted me home.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_61">LXI.</h2>


<p>It was in September, ’73; I had much worldly
business on hand for present time, and much that
was prospective. I was sixty-three years old, yet
in my prime; for I felt as if what Montaigne said
was my case: every man thinks he has twenty years
more to live—and I have done it, so at eighty-three,
I have yet twenty before me! Yet, four days
ago, December 4, ’91, was the third anni-<i>re</i>-versary
of my broken leg, which will imprison me (without
hard labour, unless word-picking and hemp-picking
are one) for the term of my natural life!</p>

<p>Henry’s stay with me in Florence was short, but
he went over the galleries with me, and the walks,
then returned to Germany, while I settled myself
down in pleasant rooms on the Lungarno Acciajoli
(No. 18), overlooking river, bridges, heights of
Boboli, Bellosguardo, and St. Miniato, my new
and cheerful winter home, the air bright, the
temperature 68° F., sun shining all day on my
delightful windows.</p>

<p>What walks I thence took; often to the Boboli
Gardens, whence falls on the vision a superb view
of the city with its various tints of brown and white,
so chaste, so compact, as to look like a massive
cameo!</p>

<p>And I walked to all the old places, to Fiesole
and back, the walk of many hours, but enchanting
all the way; now past the villa of Walter Savage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Landor, now the Villa Palmieri, the scene of the
Decameron.</p>

<p>Then the walk over the Viale, then the walk
along the sweet, soft Certosa Road, the monastery
now inhabited by a single monk, the caretaker of
the past. These walks and many others made
Florence an ideal native land.</p>

<p>Then I settled down to my table to take stock
of my work. I had, while at Bath, received many
reviews of my last volume, always favourable; and
I now contemplated a further adventure.</p>

<p>During a visit to Kelmscott, I wrote “Reminiscence,”
a poem describing the manor-house, the
river, and surrounding scenery.</p>

<p>I took this to Florence with me, together with
“Ecce Homo,” “The Exile,” and “Ortrud’s
Vision;” there I added others, “The Painter,”
“Michael Angelo,” and one or two besides, to my
little store; and some I wrote on my return to
London, the next year, making in all a dozen
poems, which came out, not before 1876, as “New
Symbols.”</p>

<p>My correspondence with Rossetti from Florence
was constant; it was after his reading “The
Painter” that he offered a suggestion to me to
write “The Sculptor,” which I did, giving it the
name of his idol, “Michael Angelo.”</p>

<p>This poem I sent to Rossetti in manuscript, and
he was pleased to return me the following gracious
reply, which I extract from a long letter.</p>

<p>“I read ‘The Sculptor,’ which may perhaps rank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
as the most masterly of your poems; some passages
(as stanza three) having absolutely a new and valuable
image in every couplet, and being as perfect in
expression as words can make them. I found the
poem still further a gainer on being submitted to
the ordeal of <i>vivâ voce</i> reading, on the occasion of
Brown’s being here lately, when the whole was
encored and several stanzas more than encored.”</p>

<p>I sketched out the “Birth of Venus” while in
Italy; this time I had seen that imaginary drama
acted, in the waters of Nervi. In reply to a copy
I sent Rossetti of it, he remarked on two lines in
the thirty-eighth stanza, where the goddess sees
herself reflected in the water. “It is an idea so
beautiful,” he said, “as to seldom occur to any poet
during a lifetime.” The lines are—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Under her rose-dipped feet, the mirror shows</div>
<div class="verse">A form divine, enamelled in the sky.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He wrote in exactly the same tone of a verse in
“Michael Angelo,” the four last lines of stanza
three.</p>

<p>Should the reader trouble himself to run his
mind over the early stanzas he will recall the
writer’s visit to Spezia, among the marble hills:
before then he had no conception of the mountains
themselves being of that precious stone; he had
only pictured to himself the quarries whence it was
drawn.</p>

<p>Mr. William Rossetti, in a review in the
<i>Academy</i>, of 1886, was so complimentary as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
call “Michael Angelo” “a sculptured poem.” The
introductory lines preceding stanza one greatly
pleased Dante Rossetti.</p>

<p>I visited the monument of the Duke d’Urbino in
the Capella dei Medici, until I had well mastered
Angelo’s greatest work, and interpreted and translated
it into metaphoric thought. I went to the
opera to set my thoughts to music, the language of
verse.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_62">LXII.</h2>


<p>We are all musicians, not that we all compose
or play—except on each other’s feelings. The
nervous system is the one marvellous harmonium.
Its strings are more in number than those of a
thousand harps, and all that is most exquisite, most
exalted, and beautiful, can be performed upon it
with a vehemence that incites to merriment or rends
the heart. It can receive and realize the concert of
a thousand voices!</p>

<p>All this we experience in our intercourse of
every day; at the sight of a beloved one, we extemporize
some pleasing harmony.</p>

<p>But this human harp has not all its rich notes
attuned and struck by others; it is more often
Eolian, and spontaneously pours out its emotions
in the solitude of its sorrow and its joy; and it is
not always music set in words or confined to our
own sphere of being. This the poet feels when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
resting in his chamber, his spirit passes into that of
others, drawn by a divine sympathy. It becomes
a concert then with many others’ trials. The
sufferings are reverberated within him, like the
sound of distant music.</p>

<p>How easy is it in this way to enter another’s
soul, to share in its tribulation, to sink as deeply
into it as to reach its self-love, and learn how like
it is to our own!</p>

<p>My friend Dr. Ewart, a physician now to St.
George’s Hospital, and a distinguished writer on
chest-affections, sent me a friendly letter to Professor
Schiff of Florence, of which I availed myself
largely. It was at that time, too, that Madox
Brown sent me a letter to Colonel Gillum, at whose
house I first met Madame Mazzini. Dr. Schiff had
the lead in science on nerve-function, and I constantly
attended his demonstrations. They were
always performed on anæstheticized dogs. I learned
much of him. He was greatly esteemed by the
Florentine Government, by whom he was given
apartments in the vacated convent of Sta. Annunciata,
together with the extensive garden.</p>

<p>Professor Schiff was not a man of the Majendie
kind who could drown all consciousness of animal
suffering in the pleasure of reading science out
of a living book; he was benevolent, and he
guarded carefully against the creature on which he
operated being alive to pain. But his emotional
enemies were too strong for him; they were chiefly
some English of fashion, and they got Capponi on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
their side; the most deservedly esteemed of Florentine
nobles, whose residence was opposite to that of
the professor.</p>

<p>This led to a correspondence between the
neighbours, which ended for a time in Schiff convincing
Capponi that no cruelty was practised, and
that the operations on animals were painless.</p>

<p>However, Schiff had many animals; the municipality
had ordered the police to supply the professor
with all stray dogs, for which they could discover no
owner. There was one dog amongst these that
would bay the moon in spite of every effort to
silence its superstitious moanings; and the enemy
hearing this, interviewed Capponi again, and told
him that Schiff was known to torture his dogs in
the night season.</p>

<p>Capponi, in his palace opposite, had only too
surely heard those midnight wailings.</p>

<p>The appointment of Professor Schiff to a chair
of physiology and to the hospital was a Government
one; his diagnosis of disease was regarded as
remarkably rapid and successful. At his house,
which was graced by Madame Schiff and her
daughter, ladies of high culture, I met many interesting
persons, one especially, a Moscow lady,
who every year went to St. Petersburg, thence to
Florence, thence to the Isle of Wight, where she
had grandchildren at school and where she visited
her friends, Lord and Lady Cottenham.</p>

<p>I speak of this lady because her love of our
country almost amounted to a passion. The people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
she said, were so kind; strangers would stop to
help her from a railway carriage! Then the Isle of
Wight, how lovely! Fuchsias flowering in the
hedgerows, and climbing up the cottage walls!</p>

<p>As in Germany the “Vicar of Wakefield” is in
every cottage, so, she said, is “Paradise Lost” in every
Russian home.</p>

<p>I wish that I could give her name.</p>

<p>The last I heard of Professor Schiff was that his
enemies had prevailed, and that he had returned to
Berne, welcomed by his own people.</p>

<p>In the November of this year, I revised “Ecce
Homo,” and composed the “Double Soul,” both of
which are in “New Symbols.” I also wrote
“Lucilla, the First Saved,” at that time, a favourite
of the good and gifted Christina Rossetti.</p>

<p>It was at this period that I was engaged on
“The Sculptor” (M. Angelo). I sat in the Hall of
Niobe for the manner, and stood in the Chapel of the
Medici for the matter, of this little poem. I sent it
as aforesaid, to Rossetti, who was at Kelmscott.</p>

<p>“Pythagoras,” too, was of this period.</p>

<p>In February, 1874, I wrote an article on some
of Professor Schiff’s work, and sent it to Dr.
Anstey, to be inserted in <i>The Practitioner</i>, in
which it shortly appeared, giving much satisfaction
to Schiff himself.</p>

<p>During this visit to “Florence my Fair,” I was
in constant correspondence with D. G. Rossetti,
Theodore Watts, and other friends; and I left behind
me many there whom I had reason to esteem.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Colonel and Mrs. Gillum showed me many kindly
attentions, not the least of which was that of asking
me to meet Madame Mazzini at their table. He, in
common with that lady, took a deep interest in a recently
deceased friend, Miss Blagden, who, through
Mr. Watts, had appointed to meet me at Florence.
She was an authoress of promise. But, before I
reached Italy, she was lying in the English cemetery
at Florence, where, with her friends, I visited her
grave.</p>

<p>It was, however, as a social centre that she took
her high position in Florence. She was the intimate
friend of Mr. and Mrs. Browning, and she is
the heroine of Madame Villari’s novel, “In Change
Unchanged.”</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_63">LXIII.</h2>


<p>I left Florence for Venice on the 2nd of March,
1874.</p>

<p>In leaving Florence I seemed to be leaving
home; on reaching Venice I seemed only on a visit,
and so I felt as long as I was there. So striking
is this city, that all who reach it determine to remain
for a length of time; but it palls upon them,
and a fortnight is generally the limit of their stay.</p>

<p>But it is always great in memory.</p>

<p>Venice! One sits in peaceful repose, no sound
of voices, or wheels, or hoofs, in the Piazza San
Marco, over coffee, which the place turns to nectar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
One swallows with insatiate mental appetite the
Duomo; and what a breakfast it is for hungry eyes!
One walks round the palace of those Doges, more
majestic than man ever was or can ever be; a prison
on the right side for the commission of cruel sins,
a cathedral round the corner for their pardon, and
that even up to plenary indulgence.</p>

<p>What a curious thing it is not to be at home, but
how most curious of all it is to be at Venice! Would
you know what it is to be there, imagine such a
town as Brighton, with all the streets filled with
water and changed to canals, with little bridges
everywhere to enable you to cross from one side of
the way to the other! Then, to turn the sea into a
Grand Canal, imagine a row of palaces outside the
piers, from Hove to Kemptown, and you are at
Venice!</p>

<p>I walked all over Venice, where walking was
possible: down <i>calle</i>, or lanes, with opposite houses
so near to each other that a good harlequin might
turn a somersault across from one window to
another!</p>

<p>Edmund Kean would have done this, though
the windows were closed.</p>

<p>One gets from <i>calle</i> to <i>calle</i> over the daintiest
little bridges, some of white chiselled marble; from
these you look up and down a canal between towering
houses, and here and there see a family keep its
gondola, as some of us at home keep our carriage.
There the gondolas are tethered to the house steps,
as our horses are to the manger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>When there is no more walking possible, one
takes to a gondola at the Piazzetta, which sweeps by
palaces of loveliest architecture on both sides of the
Grand Canal. A sort of Thames, down stream,
reaches the Rialto bridge, not built so early as
Shakespeare’s time; still, there was a bank of that
name, Riva Alto, where the merchants of Venice
met, close by; but it is a scanty spot, and little
suited to business transactions.</p>

<p>At the Rialto one gets out of the gondola and
crosses the bridge. It has paltry shops on either
side, that might have been stocked from the
vast surplus of Manchester or Birmingham. One
returns to one’s gondola, ready to drop a mean
opinion, and resume one’s sense of beauty. “What
palace is this, O songless Signor Gondolier?”
“The General Post Office, signor,” answers the
gondolier. We glide to and fro, we pause before
the Fondaco dei Turchi, and look at it until we feel
that its beauty can never be erased from our mental
vision.</p>

<p>We pause before the Palazzo Pesaro, before La
Ça Doro, Il Palazzo Guistiniani, Il Palazzo Foscari.
We think we should like to live in them all, and we
think what a great lord it would take to live in any
one of them.</p>

<p>A tremendous organization is that of Venice
still. The fine arsenal that stands boldly out, as
one looks down the canal, might say <i>aut pax, aut
bellum</i>! The Gallery, a convent turned into a
palace of art. It supplied me with an answer once,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
when I was shown a property in Titians by a
friend in London. He confidently inquired of me if
I did not think they were genuine works. My
answer was, “Go to Venice, look at the Titians
there, and on your return ask me the question again.”</p>

<p>Then the churches; they are of course noble,
but I cannot love anything that is angular, which to
me—but I am only one!—is the fault of ecclesiastical
architecture in Italy. I could say much of angularity:
all that ranks beneath the human form is
angular. As a type, study the features of a cat!
Its ears are angular, its eyes are angularly set, its
nose, its mouth all form angles. I love the dome,—my
own St. Paul’s, St. Peter’s at Rome, S. Maria
del Fiore at Florence, the Basilica di San Marco,
and the S. Maria della Salute at Venice—all noble
churches; and yet the wonderful St. Mark’s is provokingly
like the Pavilion at Brighton, only it is not
Chinese but Byzantine.</p>

<p>The Doge’s palace, empty but full of reminiscences!
Art there takes the place of old Reality:
it laughs at the security of living queens and kings.
St. Mark’s Square is like another and more charming
Palais Royal; its arched windows soothe and
fascinate the eyes.</p>

<p>There is a long, broad street in Venice—the
Via Garibaldi. It is sixty of my feet wide; and
there are two good squares, the Piazza Santo Maurizio
and the Piazza Santo Stefano.</p>

<p>I had a very odd sensation on reaching these
squares: I felt just as if I was on dry land!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>When one thinks of a city of solid houses
situated on a network of water, it may naturally
recall the moats that surround fortified castles. But
an enemy could cross a moat: could he riddle his
way through the countless canals of Venezia? How
safe must the inhabitants of the interior feel in time
of war! If an army starting from the square of
St. Marco reached the <i>calle</i>, it would have to march
in single file between windows that might be used
as loopholes.</p>

<p>Venice was very cold in the month of March. I
complained. “Never mind,” was the reply; “we
shall have the mosquitoes in April, and they will
bring six months of warm weather!”</p>

<p>This is Italy: cold winters and no provision
against cold! The natives get hot-through in the
six spring and summer months, and it takes the
remaining six to cool them.</p>

<p>If I ascended in a captive balloon which broke
loose, making me a prisoner, to undergo the sentence
of transportation with hard-breathing in the cold,
scant air; and if offered a ticket-of-leave and a
parachute, with a choice of where I would descend,
it would be in St. Mark’s Square, the sun shining,
the band playing, the cup of hot coffee on the table
just poured out. It is the only perfect square upon
earth—no dust, no noisy cabs to run over your toes
as you stretch out your legs on the smoothly paved
ground.</p>

<p>Seated in the Piazza San Marco over coffee and
cigar, one reflects how Venice has more than one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Shakespearian interest: how the Rialto, now a
bridge, was in our dramatist’s day a bank of the
Grand Canal, the <i>riva alto</i>. But a yet greater
interest attaches to the circumstance which led him
wrong, yet right, in his not knowing that there were
two Othello families, one of which was distinguished
as Il Moro, the Mulberry, because they held estates
in the Morea.</p>

<p>And this was Shakespeare’s Moor!</p>

<p>London is dusty, every other town is dusty;
Venice is not. London registers a good one death
per diem under cab wheels. In Venice a cab wheel
is never seen; but whether the bicycle has reached
it now I do not know.</p>

<p>I went one evening to the Malibran theatre,
and on Sunday to the Fenice opera house. I had
indulged my eyes to the full, so I gave my ears a
turn, and they were gratified in hearing William
Tell. I did not fail to visit the island of Lido in a
steam ’bus to see the true Adriatic. The clean
sands, whence no land is visible, is all that is to be
seen there, though, as I did, you walk across from
shore to shore.</p>

<p>I scarcely completed the traditional fortnight
at Venice, but it was not my last visit there. What
had I seen? It was like something colossal, though
only human; it was like having turned over a huge
book of wonderful pictures, leaf after leaf: the first
an enchanted square, its mosque, its more than
kingly palace, its obtrusive campanile; lastly, a
wonderful line of arches, a mile long between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Venice and the coast, along which glided a railway
train.</p>

<p>When I had dwelt on every page of the volume
and reached the end, I had no desire to begin
again, but took the treasured-up remembrance of
it across the Brenner.</p>

<p>Sleeping at Verona, I stayed there for a day
that I might see the great fortress, which forms
part of the quadrilateral, and also the Roman
coliseum there, which is in a very perfect state.
The town must have suffered much from time,
even since Shakespeare’s “Two Gentlemen” left it
to make the acquaintance of Sylvia. As I stood
on the bridge and looked about me, the houses
seemed to be crumbling before my very eyes.
This done, I proceeded to Stassfurt, taking Munich
on my way.</p>

<p>I remained for several months at Stassfurt, the
summers in Germany always being for the most part
fine. I made excursions with some of my family into
the Harz, went up and round the mountains, spent
a night on the Brocken, witnessed the sun rise from
beneath my feet, and made a stay afterwards at
Thale, ascending the picturesque heights from that
locality. We took our route to the Harz by the
weird Affenthaler valley, visiting the admirable old
lordly castle of Falconstein on our way, and not for
the last time. The sombre hills, the narrow pass,
the pine forest on either side, the river, once seen
can never but be recalled to mind again.</p>

<p>The Brocken is covered with huge masses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
stone, evidently the work of a volcano. Other
masses have been hurled downwards, rudely paving
the pine-covered descent. I suggested that the
scattered heaps on the summit should be piled up
as a rude and lasting monument to Goethe.</p>

<p>I had yet to make my visit to Rome; it was
from Stassfurt again. The weather in October
was getting cold over the plains of Saxony, and
my son-in-law, Dr. Dupré, reminded me that it
would be still colder on the Alps. He went with
me on part of my journey; we took train from
Leipsic to Munich, arriving at dark, and renewed
our tickets for Botzen. There we had supper in
company with a smart English-Greek, a native of
Corfu, and his friend, together with a French lady
of fine proportions and laughing face, besides a
young Bavarian officer of the rapid-mannered
kind.</p>

<p>There were other rooms in the hotel besides
the one in which we supped, and to which the
three gentlemen described followed the lady
wherever she went, her laughter taking the form
of fits. And such is the politeness of what we
call foreigners, they accompanied her even to her
chamber door. She returned to the supper-room
after all this. Dr. Dupré was there alone, and she
told him, half in complaint, the other half in fun,
what had been going on.</p>

<p>With this company of three I found myself in
the same carriage the next day, the Greek and his
friend leaving us the following day, at noon, at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
house in that wonderful Alpine gorge between
Botzen and Verona.</p>

<p>Dr. Dupré was on his return home, <i>viâ</i> Strasburg,
where he went to purchase a horse from the
king’s stables. I proceeded with the young officer
and the lady.</p>

<p>The journey to Bologna which we made together
was a comedy in a hundred acts, as long as a
great Chinese drama. The gentleman perched
himself on the arm of the seat, and took out a well-thumbed
book of conversations in the usual four
languages, to practise himself in the Italian, and
from this he read aloud to the lady, who sat
opposite to him, in the tone of one earnestly
addressing another, now on business as if she
were hotel-keeper, waiter, chambermaid, jeweller,
dressmaker, or barber. She heartily enjoyed his
frankness, and laughed over every question and
answer.</p>

<p>That night we slept at Bologna, the lady proceeding
to Naples, the officer taking down her
address and promising to pay her a visit there
before long.</p>

<p>When I left the German side of the Brenner it
was in the cold season; the leaves were colouring,
drooping, and falling. When I reached the plain
of Lombardy the summer had not stirred, all was
green and warm.</p>

<p>I went from Bologna to Florence (the beloved)
with my Bavarian. There were two English ladies
and their brother, a surgeon-major of artillery, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the same carriage with us, and we entered into a
rapid acquaintance, I and the gentleman through
professional, and the young officer and the ladies
through moral, sympathy. He amused them as
effectually as he had done the madame. We proceeded
to the same hotel at Florence, the Porta
Rossa. My German took the ladies about, with
his open Bädeker, and showed them all the sights.
They were single ladies, and, therefore, very much
charmed. One day, walking with them on a country
stroll, it evidently occurred to him that it was his
duty to tell them who he was, and his way of doing
this afforded them much amusement. He suddenly
stopped before a cluster of violets, and bending his
head to address them, said, “Sweet flowers, I dare
say you would be pleased to know my name, who
and what I am. My name is ⸺, and I am a
captain in the Bavarian army!”</p>

<p>I lingered at Florence for a month, looking at
my favourite models of art, the chief of which now
was the Perseus, by Cellini, and what I loved to
linger over, never tiring, the Six Vestals, of Greek
sculpture in the Loggia dei Lanzi.</p>

<p>But to dwell too long on such exquisite works
of man’s genius almost infatuates; whilst gazing on
a single object one seems to frame from memory
an old and new testament of the inspired artists,
and to call some of them evangelists, and some
apostles.</p>

<p>Look at Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper at
Milan, in the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
it is amongst the finest pictures in the world. And
was it not inspired?</p>

<p>Look at the Twilight and the Dawn, the
Night and Morning, of Michael Angelo: would it
not illustrate the book of the creation?</p>

<p>Look at the Paradiso of Fra Angelico for a
new art testament, and for an old one go back to
the Parthenon, to the sculptures of ancient Greece.</p>

<p>During my short stay I visited all my most
valued friends, and on the 21st of November I took
train to Rome.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_64">LXIV.</h2>


<p>It is an amusing journey from Firenze to Rome.
The Apennines, no longer imposing to one familiar
with the Alps, spin with you; arches that you see
above you go round and return nearer to you;
then, swinging round once more, you are upon them,
and finally above them.</p>

<p>A young Jesuit sat in the corner of the carriage
opposite to my corner. On my first sight of him
his eyes were closed, and his lips were moving as
one sees in the low muttering delirium of the semi-conscious
sick. In due time he took out a breviary,
counted the beads on a string that hung from him,
played with them as a child with sugar-plums, and
pursued the silent muttering, as if reading a delirious
dream. This went on for a fatiguing length of time.
Being unaccustomed to religious manners, I felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
sorry, because I thought the good man was fatuously
disposed, when suddenly he, having counted his last
bead, shut his book joyfully, and his intellect seemed
restored.</p>

<p>He addressed me in sweet Italian, in <i>la lingua
Toscana in bocca Romana</i>. We were gliding alongside
the lake of Perugia, and from that time he did
not cease to instruct me until our journey’s end.</p>

<p>A Jesuit is never wanting in knowledge, whatever
a priest may be.</p>

<p>If we swept by a ruined bridge, he told me to
what period of history it pertained, and to what
event it owed its smashed condition; if we came to
a hillside town, I heard from him its name, and for
what it had been famed. So, as if school itself had
become a delicious holiday, we passed by Perugia
and Assisi and Terni, and other of these storied
towns.</p>

<p>Italians tell one what they are. He was a
Jesuit; he had found shelter among the nobles of
Florence, who loved their old Government and
hated their new, and who were generous to the
clergy who had been turned out of their monasteries,
then all empty. But a few months of employment
awaited him; the libraries had been removed from
the monasteries to the capital, and he had been
summoned to assist in their arrangement.</p>

<p>“<i>Non mi piace la vostra Roma</i>,” said Victor
Emmanuel, after his first session there as king. It
gave great offence; yet must I humbly repeat his
words on my own account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>I have imagined ancient Rome; I have seen a
picture of it restored in all its grandeur. What does
it look like now? A grand city that had been
lifted bodily from the seven hills and valleys into
the air, and let to fall, smashed in pieces, like a
service of crockery.</p>

<p>“<i>… Non mi piace la vostra Roma</i>” were the
words of the king, so I may venture to repeat them.</p>

<p>The place is very disappointing at first, but they
say it grows upon you. The misfortune is that it
is called Rome instead of Popesburg—ancient Rome
is squeezed out; but Popesburg is a picturesque
old Italian town, interspersed scantily with remains
yet older. The Pantheon stands up complete on its
old pillars, only stripped of all its outside marble;
then, near Santa Maria in Cosmedia, there is a
lovely little temple of Vesta, encircled by its
Corinthian marble columns, but its surroundings are
of mud and slush at this hour.</p>

<p>These interspersed antiquities, of which there
are many in the form of columns, with a pediment
sadly bruised and broken through age and fight, are
the most picturesque of the remains. Where they
turn up as forums, the wreck is exhibited some
twelve or twenty feet deep in large walled-in pits,
like outdoor museums—bits of columns arranged in
old order, like skittles, ready to be bowled over
again. Perhaps the most curious thing of all is to
see modern Rome from the bridges, itself decaying
and crumbling, when the ancient city has already
crumbled and decayed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>During the last eight hundred years there has
been a sort of rebuilding, but it is not the <i>urbs
recondita</i> of Augustus, whose Pantheon is still standing
to connect the present with the past. Why, the
columns of that temple, as I paced them, measured
a diameter of eight feet! Where other temples had
stood, churches have sprung up; and where the
sherds of foundations remained, there are palaces
now; but the palace of the Cæsars is empty space;
the Forum is a skeleton exhumed for show. The
gaps will never be filled again; Rome will remain a
ruin; its architectural condition only such as one
might conceive of Hades, where Hercules wanders
still in disaffection. How unlike its later contemporary,
Venice, that has been preserved, perfect, under
a blue-glass sky!</p>

<p>The antiquarian genius is always very busy at
Rome, because its exhumations supply food to
greedy minds bent on recovering the earliest history
of our race, as if the future of mankind would one
day turn up engraved on tiles. These sort of
enthusiasts do not comprehend that the further they
go back, the greater grows the historic lie, and that
as far as it concerns true knowledge, their labours
are utterly fruitless. Antiquarians and geologists
are both earth-searchers; but does the ruin-grubber
deem himself on a par with the inspector of organic
remains?</p>

<p>I took my view of the Transfiguration of Rome,
moulded by the avenger in a way no man could
paint or model. I wanted to see the other Transfiguration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
which art-genius pronounced the finest
picture in the known world, as if it were as great a
miracle as the one it represents.</p>

<p>Rome is rich in metamorphoses, besides being
one itself: the fine bronze statue in the cathedral, a
figure of Jupiter, has been transfigured into Peter,
who reigns in its stead.</p>

<p>But the most valued Transfiguration of all is
Raphael’s: it has a fault of the first magnitude,
a ghastly fault that hands it over to the ruins.</p>

<p>The great painter was but a fragmentary genius,
or he would not have made that hideous epileptic
the conspicuous rival of Christ. Our eyes join the
eyes of the painted crowd in looking at a sight so
loathsome, and that in so healing a Presence.</p>

<p>But let us be thankful: Raphael has left us his
mighty cartoons, his portraits, his Madonnas.</p>

<p>There were other treasures of art in the Vatican,
notably the Laocoon, that I desired earnestly to
examine. I had need to speak of it in my “sculptured
poem,” but could draw no inspiration from it
in the copy at Florence. Strange to say, though
the copy and the original are so alike, the moment
I saw this last its life passed into me. I required
also to look at the Apollo Belvidere, but found it
to be only Lord Chesterfield during his apotheosis.</p>

<p>In the Doge’s palace in Venice there is a striking
picture of Ariadne. I knew there was a sculpture
of the same in the Vatican gallery, a place which
may be called an indoor street of marbles: this, too,
I found. Then I made my way to the very end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
of this Via di Scolpitura, where stood the Athlete.
How long I stayed with my eyes and heart upon it,
I know not; but while looking at that most natural
of all marble wonders, every Apollo had disappeared
from mythology, from this world itself.</p>

<p>But now to the Barberini Palace, to visit the
apocryphal portrait of Beatrice Cenci. We could
kiss the very canvas did we not know that her
tragedy is but a myth. She breathed into Shelley
her tragic breath, so we all go to see the familiar
face; and, hard by the Ghetto, the Cenci palace,
too. But this, how changed. It was let out to the
dirtier class by its then owner—a cardinal, too; and
I saw that the grand entrance at the back was
used for a dust-heap. All the property of a cardinal,
all going to decay; yet is there a cleanly church
opposite, built at the cost of a Cenci.</p>

<p>It is with some loss of equanimity that one
thinks of Roma and finds that its citizens are proud
of it in its humbled and chastised condition. It
is like the worn-out pedigree of a once illustrious
name. They may be proud of their tombs, for
one is of the Scipios, of Seneca another; but their
ruins are a disgrace, the work of their avenging,
conquering foes, such as Guiscard in the eleventh
century, who battered down every wall that it
might never be defended again. But they are
proud of their ruins! Their Forum, a bit of
Palmyra; their Coliseum, a broken cup; their ghost
of the palace of the Cæsars, its own burial-place; of
their Baths of Caracalla, an artificial desert;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
of their Theatre of Marcellus, in one of the fine
arches of which I saw a flourishing blacksmith’s
forge, blazing to the memory of a glorious past.</p>

<p>Imagine the Florentines proud of their Palazzo
Vecchio, with its mighty tower on the pavement;
imagine the Venetians proud of a once Doge’s
palace, the magnificent court where it was with
only a wall or two standing, and the giant’s staircase,
like Goliath, in the dust!</p>

<p>There are some old words that one likes better
than the new ones: the name of the gate, now <i>del
Popolo</i>, does not, to me, sound so æsthetically as
<i>Flaminia</i>, its ancient name! Yet it took centuries
to turn the one into the other for the worst, with
the patriotic intention of being for the best! The
popes do not pretend to be Cæsars, like the latter-day
Napoleon, with his Dutch physiognomy; but
they have now and then done their best to rebuild.
Pius VII., so heavily handicapped by the Corsican
<i>parvenu</i>, did much to lay the saddened ghost of
Cæsarean times, by beautifying the Piazza del
Popolo. Through him, Augustus might have
looked on it again with composure. Its semicircular
form, its fountains, its statues, would pacify
the imperial rebuilder.</p>

<p>From the Porta del Popolo to the Capitol is a
line ending in a steep ascent, one of the seven hills,
the Capitoline: this long street is the backbone of
Rome, from which its ribs more or less radiate. It
is not gigantic with a broad stride, like the Via
Larga (now Cavoura) at Florence; it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
beautiful, like the Genoese Via Nuova; it is more
of a Bond Street, but a long one, with some fine
buildings, and, as all long streets should be, it is cut
in half by a good big square, the Piazza Colonna.
Here we stumble against a column, look up, and for
a minute or two we are in ancient Rome. It was set
up by Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, a man of fight,
in order that his victories might not be forgotten.
Its inside is hollow, except that it has steps up it,
nearly two hundred—for we always count. We go
up these steps, full of the Roman sensation, when,
lo, and behold! (En et ecce! as Marcus Aurelius
would now say with a stare), St. Paul has got up
before us; has been turned into bronze, and gilded!
Still there is something in it; he has made conquests
over the Germans better than those of Marcus,
so we may let him stay at the top, and be thankful;
odd as it seems.</p>

<p>The obelisk which we come upon in the square
of Monte Clitorio, was brought to Rome by
Augustus, as Cleopatra’s Needle was brought to
London by Sir Erasmus Wilson, Kt., F.R.C.S.; the
one set up in the Campus Martius, the other on the
Thames Embankment. That of Augustus got buried,
and by a sort of lucky miracle was raised again by
the sixth of the Pius popes.</p>

<p>But now stop a little longer than usual: this is
the Palazzo Doria Pamfili.</p>

<p>One wants all the time to get up to the top of
the Capitoline Hill; so, seeing a tremendous flight
of steps, one goes upstairs. The things stuck in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
one’s way to arrest one’s progress towards the square
at the top are first of all two lions. These, notwithstanding
they are created out of black granite, and
are therefore really dumb animals, unlike live lions,
spout water at you, by way of making themselves
heard: and this Keats should have done into the
public ear, instead of letting his name be writ in the
water itself.</p>

<p>But even now we cannot leave the last step to
the Campidoglio; we are arrested by Castor and
Pollux, two giants. We then look with much
interest to see what sort of horses theirs were, and
they rise in our estimation, tall as they are already,
when we find that their nags are of the true Arab
breed, thick-necked and straight-backed, not a bit
like the flesh and blood abnormals of Newmarket
Heath.</p>

<p>The Campidoglio is a fine square, and one has
at least the satisfaction of feeling that the hill it
surmounts is a part of ancient Rome. But where
is the old Temple of Jupiter? we ask.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>However, here is something Roman: it is the
equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius—a survival.</p>

<p>There are other things up here of the Antonine
brand, to show that Rome was once Rome; but
there is such a variety of job lots here, all curiosities,
swept by time into heaps, that the best course
is not to puzzle one’s brains about them.</p>

<p>I, for one, wanted to see three things in this
Capitol, still so called, but not recalling anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
that existed under that name before Boniface IX.
took to rebuilding. It is a museum containing
a good deal of the private property of the old
Roman lords, which belongs now to their natural
heirs, and farthest off of kin, the people.</p>

<p>These people had ancestors who were the hereditary
property of some seventy or eighty emperors.
They are now owners of all these emperors’ heads,
and of the heads of all these emperors’ families,
which they keep on shelves in their Capitol museum,
in a room that makes a sort of Golgotha.</p>

<p>At last we come upon the Dying Gladiator,
one of the three figures I was in search of. We
have all seen its shadow in casts and engravings;
this is the unique original.</p>

<p>Another figure that I had occasion to see was
La Bacchante, a marble figure, which is locked up
and only shown on the payment of a fee; it is a
most expressive statue.</p>

<p>These two figures I have delineated in my
“sculptured poem” of Michael Angelo.</p>

<p>A third figure, the Faun, I readily found. It
is a celebrated statue, and I desired to ascertain
whether the ears were formed correctly; but they
were not. In accordance with anatomical structure
they should have pointed backwards, but they are
erect. Some would say, “Yes; for the ears of
lower animals at times are pricked.” But I say
(it is in “Valdarno”), the end of all art is repose.</p>

<p>In the human ear may be seen a small rudiment
of the elongated ear; it is so placed that, if redeveloped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
it would point posteriorly, after the
fashion of the lower animals, to the cervix, beneath
the occipital bone.</p>

<p>Was it prophetic that, in digging the foundations
of the Capitol, when it was first designed, a skull
was turned out (caput), whence the name.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Capitol was founded upon a
rock, though it was the Tarpeian.</p>



<hr />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_65">LXV.</h2>


<p>“What come ye for to see?” It is a wider
question than was intended on its first ironical
utterance, and many answers are always ready. A
medical ignoramus of ability was asked if there was
any danger. His answer was, “That depends on
the event.” So it is in museum life; the majority
know nothing of what they go to see, and what they
do see depends on the event. But the specialists
know exactly what go they for to see; and I am
one of these. Relying on presumptive evidence,
if a “Sir Leighton,” as the French would say, goes
to Rome, it may be for to make a study of painted
eyes, in some ten or a dozen galleries, to determine
whether black, brown, or blue predominates. If a
“Sir Boehm” goes to Rome, it may be for to inspect
the lost head and legs of a Farnesian Hercules.
If a “Sir Barry” goes to Rome, it is for
to examine which of the stones in the Palazzo di
Venezia were stolen by a pope from the Coliseum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
and which were honestly got. However, we have
no “Sir Barry” nowadays; premiers do not build
houses, so that they do not baronetize architecture
in lieu of fees. They take physic; they stand in
need of bulletins when, on the eve of an unpleasant
debate, a strong voice is weak. Being ourselves
of physic and a little deaf, a clergyman once bawled
into our best ear, in a voice so thunderous yet so
piercing that had it been a prayer it might almost
have been heard in heaven, “Doctor! can you
give me something to strengthen my voice?”</p>

<p>Premiers are perfect artists in the baronetizing
line; nay, they can even chisel a peer in invisible
gold. A president of a royal academy, of a royal
society, of a royal college of surgeons or physicians,
fills a genteel trade; rank fits him well.</p>

<p>An oculist, if a premier has bad eyes and is
going blind, may, like other professionals, be ennobled;
but an aurist and a dentist, there is something
in these—it is hard to say what—that does
not ennoble well, which shows how greater are eyes
than ears or teeth.</p>

<p>If a premier is not a teetotaler, he makes lords
out of brewers, and yet not out of distillers, whose
images are quite as golden. He does not mind it
being thought that he takes a glass of pale ale, but
whisky—that would not do.</p>

<p>All these industries, like myself, go to Rome
chiefly on their own business. But what a wonderful
crowd there is flocking there to see all that is
left—the fragments of Cæsar’s lost compositions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>We business men, when we have found all we
want, go the round; it is like walking through the
street, looking at everybody, sometimes stopping to
speak.</p>

<p>We meet a picture, a statue, a vase, an arch,
a column, a palace, as we might do a friend; but
those who undertake to see all might as well undertake
to read the two or three billion letters that
pass through the post-office in a year.</p>

<p>I set myself to visit the grave of poor Keats.
He was sick of many griefs, but the greatest of
these was that he could not make the vulgar howl
their applause. He had all the enjoyment of a
Divine gift; it could only be the bodily sickness
affecting the mind when his heart was bitter, and
he exclaimed his name was writ in water. Yet they
have graved those feeble words on his tombstone!</p>

<p>Were I dying for praise, I should show my
insight into man, and say, “My name is writ in
brandy and water.” How that would be swallowed
down!</p>

<p>I visited Keats’s grave from very mixed motives;
life is sad enough without being sentimental. To
stand before the grave is a little dangerous; if one
walked backwards for a short distance in an absent
fit, he would precipitate himself over a sunk wall
into the adjoining cemetery, and lie there for good,
like Shelley.</p>

<p>As in duty bound, I visited the tomb of Shelley
also.</p>

<p>I was on my way to the church of St. Paolo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
<i>fuori</i>, a sight not to be neglected by any species
of pilgrim whatever.</p>

<p>On one’s way one can leave a card on the
Scipios; their tomb is handy, but they are always
out, those wonderful people called the “authorities”
having removed the sarcophagi and busts. But
you will be asked in; and you can go down the
windings by torchlight, and say you did it. Then,
<i>en route</i>, one can pay one’s respects to the early
Christians who owned some uncomfortable catacombs
hereabout, in which they resided.</p>

<p>For an account of these and of how they shelved
their dead, <i>vide</i> some more gushing writer.</p>

<p>St. Paolo is too magnificent for a church. It
has a fine architectural pedigree up to Constantine,
having endured all the horrors for generations of
decay and fire, to be only rebuilt at greater cost
than before.</p>

<p>I did not go on purpose to behold the church,
but to almost adore the ancient cloisters at the back.
The delicately twisted columns of the arches are so
winning, they actually awake one’s affections; and
if thinking of a thing ever after is love, they fill
you with this fondest of recollections.</p>

<p>A good many of us rise in life. Wolsey, he rose;
the Bonapartes rose; Coke rose (upon Littleton);
the Gladstones rose; Lazarus rose; but no man,
priest, soldier, lawyer, M.P., or resurrect, ever rose
in death, as did St. Peter. Matthew, Mark, Luke,
and John; writers as eminently inspired as Isaiah;
Paul, the most gifted of apostles, whose ideas on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
charity lifted Christianity miles over the heads of
all other religious or moral founders, had no such rise
in death as Peter; but it was the keys that did it.</p>

<p>Peter has a palace, and a church, and a museum,
such as monarchs envy in vain. Let us hope, pray,
and entreat that it may never be demolished, like the
palace of the Cæsars; that no republican Guiscard
may arise; but that the President of the Future may
take up his residence there, should the popes vacate it.</p>

<p>My friend, Theodore Watts, was at Rome with
me a part of the time. I forget what he thought of
it all; it is so long ago. I know we visited the
poets’ tombs together, and St. Paolo <i>fuori</i>.</p>

<p>Pio Nino must have had a temper, because he
studied the inconvenience of strangers by making
them take tickets of admission in front of the
Vatican, while he vaticinated that the back entrance
not being handy, but involving a long walk, would
excite irritation, so he admitted visitors only at his
back door. The elliptical columns forming the
portico in the Piazza S. Pietro, look like out-bent
arms for receiving and hugging the flock.</p>

<p>I was with Watts, one day in December, on this
little round. We stood with our backs against a
wall, for shelter against a bitter wind, the sun
shining through snow, and the warmth, so long as
we remained there, delicious.</p>

<p>We went the usual round of the loggie, Raphaelizing,
and of the indoor statuary squares and streets;
and got into the Sixtine, on the roof of which
Michael Angelo re-created the world.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_66">LXVI.</h2>


<p>I have left England twice since my visit to
Rome: once in 1878, to stay at Ballenstedt, near
the Harz, for a summer; once more to Stassfurt,
for a prolonged sojourn. In my own country, Bath
has been my favourite place, where I have been for
several seasons. Brighton, too, I have often visited,
having my brother there. Neither have I neglected
the Isle of Wight, my favourite spot being on the
unfashionable West, at Totland’s Bay.</p>

<p>There is, however, little left to say about
England, by a native, therefore little to record;
but I have found plenty to do at home.</p>

<p>Among other sights, while at Ballenstedt—it was
in 1878—we went to the Duke of Brunswick’s castle
of Blankenburg; not going over its four hundred
chambers, but confining ourselves very much to the
billiard-room and chapel. In that apartment the
walls were decorated with engravings of race-horses,
and of British sports of every kind—fox-hunting,
cricket, and other games—all that are ever seen in
shop-windows or elsewhere. A billiard-table occupied
a corner of the room, with the rules of the
game hung near it. The ducal family were Anglicized
by the war, and the black dress of the troops
is still worn. The chairs in the room were all
backed by the arms of England and the Order of
the Garter.</p>

<p>In the chapel there is an ivory crucifix attributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
to Michael Angelo. The floor is, in one place,
ostentatiously unboarded, to show the foundation to
be rock.</p>

<p>Ballenstedt is a pleasant summer town. There
is a fine avenue leading to the castle, and to the
public gardens; the forest is close at hand, and a
chain of trout streams and lakes descends from the
neighbouring hills.</p>

<p>The Affenthaler valley, too, abuts on the place,
leading to Falconstein, in whose castle are some of
the noblest stag-antlers ever seen.</p>

<p>All that is written, all that comes to pass, has
its concluding chapter; I am fast approaching mine.</p>

<p>In writing these memoirs, a love of my fellows
has dominated my pen, as it does, always, in what
I compose, for serious perusal. I am sometimes
surprised at finding how this feeling keeps the upper
hand, as, in the ordinary sense, it is not always
deserved, nor always quite felt at starting: but it
warms. As I began by saying, so I repeat, that,
in a certain way, I am my own posterity; and,
perhaps, I revive in myself the better feelings that
a dead man would assuredly experience if he came
suddenly to life.</p>

<p>I may end by saying yet a few more words
about myself in concluding. As a sort of posterity
I may allude even to the circumstance that my
memory serves me as well as ever, as this memoir
shows, and that, but for my disaster, I could give
myself a certificate of health that would satisfy the
most prying of life insurance companies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>I have all the buoyancy of youth! As a sort
of posterity I have almost a disposition, in some
things, to appreciate myself; but at this point
decency forbids. I have quite recently written, 1st,
a volume of “Epigrams,” from an experience quite
deserving the attention of every innocent novice who
looks up to mankind; 2nd, a volume of “Sonnets”;
3rd, my “Memoirs”; 4th, “Miscellaneous Essays
and Verse.”</p>

<p>My mind holds out; it has increased in accuracy
up to the present time, now that my 84th year has
set in with a rush. But I find that my eyesight
deteriorates, though slowly, and that, like everything
else that is inevitable, I can bear it, though I should
like to have my observers back, so lovely is the
clear light of day!</p>

<p>I would altogether cease from work, but that
time would hang so heavily. I shall be as idle as I
can, and so end mine as Byron began his “Hours.”</p>

<p>In writing my memoirs the years have shrunk
into days, but they fairly depict my part of Nature’s
message of which she made me a <i>commissionaire</i>.
She has told through me, in the fragmentary form
of opinion, what her purpose is after being filtered
through my brain, not what it is prior to the process
of filtration, which leaves behind the insoluble
matters, which, try as one will, are not to be got at.
All things are comical in the process of production—the
furnaces, the looms, the raw material, now a
fibre, now a thread dipped in dye, now in mad haste
rolling into a texture, now snipped with scissors into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
a man’s or woman’s shape, now on their backs as
they make each other a bow, or kiss hands across a
street, the bricks of which a year before were in
a clay field growing wheat.</p>

<p>The epigrams that I have ready for the press,
whenever the public may be disposed for a fresh
<i>jeu d’esprit</i>, are three hundred and sixty-six in
number, to correspond with leap-year.</p>

<p>They more or less pourtray the laughing side of
life, but are not without their earnest moments, and
they have references of ludicrous applicability.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that while that species of
humour is liked and largely pervades our best
authors, epigram has never been made a specialty
by any one of them. There exists, therefore, a blank
under this heading; and my attempt is to fill this
vacancy in our literature, strange as it is that such
should still be left among its crowded pages.</p>

<p>A poem, of whatever length, should start vividly,
so as to wind up the ear and set the mind ticking.
I have known poems with much latent beauty in
them, set aside as rubbish, from failing to wake up
the thoughts at starting. I remember a sonnet
which an admirer pronounced the finest in the language
(with about as much sense as George No. IV.
called himself the first gentleman in Europe), and
which had a clear-cut symmetry and depth, being
called trashy by one who had critical power, but
who did not warm his wax before taking its impression.
Short poems have value to the author of
them as being written on passing occasions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
thus becoming biographic. I possess a volume of
this sort, called “Many Moods,” some of which have
had publication.</p>

<p>Life is a comedy during this filtration, by means
of which it receives its mysterious consciousness
through a vulgar brain; death would be a comedy
but that the joke is stale.</p>

<p>Nature seems as opinionated as she is universal.
She uses millions of millions of brain-filters, all different,
and all at the same time, in her thought-factory;
the results some of us refilter to render
them purer! The proceeding is ludicrous in the
extreme at first sight, but it is amusing; and, strange
to say, like the uproar of a mob, or sounds from a
thousand blacksmiths’ forges, they unite into final
harmoniousness.</p>

<p>Of my latter works above named, “The New
Day” only has passed from darkness through man’s
cerebral filter into the light. They have all been
written during the mental cheerfulness of much
bodily suffering, of which I have a pretty good
twinge as I now scribble. A cracked hip never ceases
to reproach me for having fallen on it, and cracked
dreams pursue me through the night; but I can still
smile, though I have no teeth to add grace to that
labial twist which is so expressive of contentment.</p>

<p>All is for the best, devils on ticket-of-leave notwithstanding.
Apparent evil generates and brings
about good. Could we only obtain one glimpse of
the invisible, which is so vast in comparison with all
we dream of, how amazingly concurrent in this my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
view would men become. All would be judges; as
on the delivery of a judgment from a full bench, all
would say, “I concur.”</p>

<p>Evil has no place in the <i>ultimatum</i>, as will be
found when that great diplomatic document is pronounced.</p>

<p>I reverence Nature, though she is wholly unaware
of the homage I pay her. She is president of the
abeternal, adeternal commonwealth, in which every
atom exercises its vote, and yields her the beneficent
despotism over all, that can be never shaken.</p>

<p>Those who can climb, in mental sight, their
pleasant little knoll, and survey the surroundings,
are burdened not with reverence for their fellow-men.
They are conscious of no inferiority in the
presence of their betters, so slight is the difference
between the great and small; and they are conscious
of no superiority in the presence of their inferiors.</p>

<p>All are so alike in actual importance among the
so mighty things around, that were all who have
lived, or are yet existing, to be arranged in a line,
beginning with Shakespeare and Newton, Homer
and Pythagoras, Phidias and Aristotle, Bacon, John
Hunter and Goethe, followed by professors and
students, labourers and mendicants, and ending with
those who slobber while they talk,—and were the
best made to stand forward in advance of the others
in a degree proportioned to their excellence, the
line of human beings, viewed at no great distance,
would appear as straight as a ray of light.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_67">LXVII.</h2>


<p>Wisdom is an attribute of old age; not because
the faculties grow keener, but rather because the feelings
are less vivid, whence there is less bias. By this
change the mind becomes more patient, more just,
therefore, towards those of opposite opinions; and
this should, above most other things, bring toleration
to bear on religion.</p>

<p>Men like Disraeli, who are a creed unto themselves,
are strongly impressed with the importance
of religion to an ignorant country. They are aware
that it is unlike what is discovered to us by Nature,
that it is a sort of distinguished stranger in the great
system of things, of so highly impressive a presence
as to be a rival force.</p>

<p>In truth, religion is, in every respect, a power;
and in relation to Nature it is <i>imperium in imperio</i>,
and is even more strong than Nature in the minds
of men.</p>

<p>It is more strong in its affinity to vast numbers,
men and women, than the dictates of nature; so
strong is its hold that it more frequently culminates
in madness than does any other passion.</p>

<p>This should be a warning to the highly endowed
intellectual and less emotional class, not to regard
religious belief as a subject of too severe analysis
and correction. Let them bear in mind that when
it is of a kind to restrain evil, to paralyze with fear
the murderer’s hand, to overawe the adulterer, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
intimidate the unjust in their dealings, to make them
do unto others as they would be done by themselves,
it is not only a grand factor for good in human
affairs, but that it is a better teacher than Nature
herself, except in the most elevated minds.</p>

<p>Religion has its little hypocrites, so has irreligion:
which of the two gives shelter to the largest
number?</p>

<p>Whom do the benevolent intellects desire to
teach? There are two classes for them to look
down upon. The credulous are the happiest of the
two and the best off; then why teach them to be
incredulous, when there are millions for whom even
their credulity is too good?</p>

<p>No one who has an acute mind should suppress
his view of religious affairs, provided he is not
offensive, because religion, though, like music,
susceptible of variations, will survive all else, as it
has ever done. Its durability belongs to the fact
that it is emotional, and so is spontaneous, while
intellectual development necessitates labour.</p>

<p>Its variations have always been adapted to the
character and capacity of a people, and its trustees
have always proved ready to effect this adaptation;
not always because it pays better, for what pays
best is that which is suitable.</p>

<p>In England there is a great variety of emotional
character, and as great a variety of creeds—some
say a hundred;—so religion among us is like a
centipede, so many legs has it to go on.</p>

<p>What suits one people does not suit all others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Leo III. established plenary indulgence and the
release of souls from purgatory through the virtue
of a mass. This does not suit many of the English
or Scotch; indeed, should any Leo III. set up a
profitable business here on the same grounds, he
would be prosecuted for obtaining money under
false pretences. But it suited the Italians at the
time, and is held in favour by many of them still.</p>

<p>The religion of the Irish appears to require some
re-adjustment; it does not in its present form give
the Divine sanction to murder.</p>

<p>The most truly religious ought to be a middle
class, who have a sufficiency of good things to
supply their wants in moderation. One does not
quite understand how the poor can work themselves
up into gratitude to Heaven in the midst of want,
or how the rich can work themselves down to it in
the midst of superabundance.</p>

<p>There is one bit of advice, too, that one might
give to the clergy, which is, not to waste too much
time in trying to evangelize their betters, but rather
to improve their own health by taking a course of
moral mud baths in what is understood by the East
End of London.</p>

<p>It would cost them less in dress.</p>

<p>Alas! for the West and the East—the gorgeous
East changed from the sunny land into the home of
the homeless, the paradise of ancient Adam yielding them
only a rotten apple off the old tree of knowledge,
while the West feeds on golden pippins!
The clergy are endowed; they can afford Eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
travel; but less than O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! they
love the slums of Shoreditch.</p>

<p>There is something tickling in the phrase, “the
fashionable clergy.” One meets them at the receptions
of a minister of State; but they do not seem
wanted there, and they stand with their hands before
them as if they had done preaching. The same
congregation will listen to them at a distance in
their box at the holy opera. But why do these
good men trouble themselves with those gilt-edged
Bible-bearers, who are gathered together in unconscious
advertisement of the newest fashions from
trans-Eastern looms, and the newest feathers from
the accommodating bird of paradise, that shed them
for their use?</p>

<p>Certainly the clergy waste their time on these
delicacies of a perfected race; they are only courtiers,
clergy of the bed-chamber, clergy-in-waiting. It is
not a nice calling for one who is manly and cultured.</p>

<p>But they are not all alike. Many begin by being
honest, and remain so for life.</p>

<p>Among the more recent events which have been
of interest to me, I would mention that, in 1885,
on the eve of a general election, my son Egmont
engaged to deliver a lecture on Gordon in the chief
cities; and very efficiently he performed his task.
He concluded the work at St. James’s Hall, where
I was present. I dined with the Walter Pollocks
and we went together to the lecture, at which Lord
Cranborne took the chair.</p>

<p>The audience was much moved during the recital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
of those circumstances which, easy to have been
avoided, led to Gordon’s death.</p>

<p>After the lecture, Mrs. Pollock introduced me to
Lady Wentworth and then to Lord Wentworth, the
grandson of Byron; also to the Baroness Burdett-Coutts,
the worthy daughter of our noblest patriot,
Sir Francis Burdett. This lady feelingly expressed
to me her regard for Gordon, and invited me to a
pleasant luncheon at her house the next day, with
Mrs. Pollock and my son and daughter.</p>

<p>But I must not go on talking for ever; my only
excuse is, as I have already hinted, I am in my
fourteenth year over death-time, and so far belong,
in a way, to posterity, in the name of which I have
occasionally ventured to opine. With this advantage
over many contemporaries, some of whom were once
of my own age, and some who were younger, I have
a right to consider myself as my own posterity too;
indeed, being fourteen years old, as such, I may
regard myself as one of the Youths of the Future.</p>

<p>Yet there is something wanting to me in this
peculiar situation. Things do not pass for the same
as they did in one’s first youth: then I looked forward,
now I look back.</p>

<p>But even this living backwards is more curious
than may appear at a first glance. It is like taking
up, let us say, some seven photos of one’s self with
a ten-years’ interval between each. The last is
wrinkled and bald; one looks at it and wonders
how a countenance could have reached so dilapidated
a stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>One takes up the one before; gazing at it, one
tries to hope backwards, but is not much encouraged;
it is still wrinkled and bald in its sixtieth year.</p>

<p>The third manifests a slight gain—the wrinkles
are in part removed, as if they had been under the
beneficial influence of cosmetics.</p>

<p>Then comes the fourth in the order of precedence,
and it is not so bad; it has all the promise
of youth.</p>

<p>We go back a little further; the previous likeness
has kept its word—it restores us to what we
have been missing so long—our early prime.</p>

<p>But here sets in a most strange mental confusion.
Up to this time we have been hoping backwards;
we have looked over a past life with ever-increasing
hope of the yet better days; our hair
has been restored to its pristine beauty, our wrinkles
are as if they had never been, our eyes are lustrous,
our first youth returns; we shall soon be fourteen
years of age once more. Of a sudden, after hoping
backwards all this way and becoming our former
selves more and more, we encounter our old hopes;
so we are hoping both ways—backward, to our beautiful
first childhood, forward to our second, in the
midst of a mental hurricane, whirling us in an instant
into old age again. So ends the pleasing retrospect—our
second youth as far off as ever from our first.</p>

<p>Photographs in my early days were not in use:
so philographs must be produced in their stead.
Daubs were as common as they are now, so we
have a national portrait gallery. Some sort of likeness
should be preserved, too, of men who have
figured in physic, not so much for their own sake as
for the dramatic addition they make to the age; so
engaging is it to know how noted people have acted
in the private play.</p>

<p>Among medical men, <i>Sir Charles Clark</i> was the
best actor: he was every man’s equal. Gay, upright
in figure, graceful, of middle stature, he seemed
always ready. He acted the least joke, and so
made it a good one. He told of how one day in
his garden he had a fit and fell on the gravel walk,
but jumped up directly and ran away for fear of his
being caught by it again.</p>

<p><i>Sir Astley Cooper</i>, when I knew him, was somewhat
aged; he had returned from the fatigues of
rest to practice again, much blamed by those who
had succeeded him in his position. He had a grand
figure; his face was flabby, his manner quiet, commanding,
kindly. Every word he said to those who
consulted him was treasured up as worth the guinea
they put down. He had a laugh that removed any
ill-founded fancy at one stroke.</p>

<p><i>Sir Benjamin Brodie</i> was a little man, thin of
feature, with a diffused acuteness of look that rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
glowed because earnest. It demanded a good forehead,
like his, and a clear eye to carry off this
bright expression.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Chambers</i> was a large, heavy man, with
thick lips, full face, prompt though bulky, seeming
to carry his advice in his whole body, and taking
his fees as if he were relieving his patient.</p>

<p><i>John Nussey</i>, the court apothecary, was a man
who had the confidence of dukes. He was of large
figure, doughy complexion, attentive manner: listening
all over. He spoke good sense, and slowly,
conveying the feeling that he had much more to say
if it so pleased him. Not being wastefully communicative,
he was sought after for what he yet had
to say.</p>

<p><i>Sir Richard Quain</i> was of a large countenance;
his head heavy, but only because it was full. He
had a quiet, not uncheerful, but almost complaining
way, at times, as if the sick world expected more of
his time than he had to give. He almost appeared
injured towards evening, in being too much in
demand. Without being deaf, his manner was a
little like that of one who was: it was so gentle.</p>

<p><i>Dr. William Gairdner</i>, a good man within himself,
had a select practice among such high people
as would allow a free-spoken physician to say what
he liked to them. He was of the Scotch blood, with
not well-shaped features, and with nose not well
finished; but a face altogether good-natured, and a
smile that drew your chair close up to his. To use
an expression that dropped from my clever nurse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
he seemed to listen with his eyes. He once said
to a man who proposed to settle in London, as
physician, “It will not suit you; it is not in you to
do as I did the other day, to put your hand on the
Lord Chancellor’s shoulder and tell him he was
incapable of speaking truth.”</p>

<p><i>Dr. J. W. B. Williams</i>, great lung-diagnoser as
he was, had a busy, moving manner, which was
more like that of a manager than of the head of a
firm.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Robert Liston</i>, the surgeon, was as playful
in private as a gigantic kitten, and liked to hear his
pretty daughter call him silly. He gave one the
impression that he could do everything, and knew
nothing. It was not very incorrect; his operating
powers were due to a wrist with which he could
have screwed off a man’s head in the days of
decapitation.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Mark Latham</i> had the knowing head and
look peculiar to those of his name. His face was
aquiline in its totality, and, like a bird, he thought on
both sides of his head, turning it first on one side,
then on another, instead of on the simultaneous
mean. He received one very heartily; if it were
about a consultation the tone was maintained, but if
not, he suddenly appeared busy.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Stone</i> was a delightful family practitioner,
with no end of good recipes for the nursery or lady’s
chamber. He was a very friendly, considerate man,
well up to every mark; and, being already confided
in by all, he was without pretension.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Thomas Watson</i> was what may be called a
learned physician. He had a nice, clever, collegiate
face, quite gentlemanly and good looking, with a
show of languor over his town practice, but very
bright when summoned to the country, as if the air
did him good. He was quite the head of his
profession.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Richard Bright</i> bore a name that covered
his entire nature. His countenance and his mind
seemed one: the acuteness, humour, brightness of
his inner character lost nothing in flowing to his
face, and even hands. His words were so exactly
like his thoughts, that on our hearing them they
became thoughts again, losing nothing in their
passage; their self-conservation of force being
unfailing.</p>

<p><i>Dr. J. A. Wilson</i> (he sometimes latinized his
initials to Maxilla) was a man to know, to esteem,
to honour. He must have improved many a man’s
memory to this day, for he was one who could never
be forgotten.</p>

<p><i>Benjamin Travers</i> was a great thinker, and a
perfect surgeon. It is difficult to describe him
personally, because he was so gentlemanly, so handsome,
of such noble bearing.</p>

<p>One may say the same of <i>Sir William Lawrence</i>,
his aspect and his work were so classic. Besides, to
describe very great men, like him, is an affront to
all the rest.</p>

<p><i>Sir Henry Acland</i>, an Oxford professor, I knew
in my time. He had all the graces peculiar to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
family. How delightful it must be for a physician,
like him, to pass through life in learned elegance
and successful ease!</p>

<p>Then there was <i>Dr. Baly</i>, with his round head,
and a face that would cheer any man who had still
an hour to live. He was a true man, and had all
the medical science of the day at his command.
But, even more than this, he knew how to manage
the sick, how to give them every advantage that
tact could devise; in a word, how to save a life if
that life was to be saved.</p>

<p>One more, the one whose name among anatomists
is the most enduring of all: <i>Dr. Robert Lee</i>.
He discovered a new nervous system when anatomy
was held to be complete. Some men are a disgrace
to society, some societies are a disgrace to men. So
was it with the Royal Society in not recognizing
Lee’s merit when the Continent was ringing with
his name.</p>

<p>These are a few of those whom I knew and
esteemed in my day.</p>

<p>Among medical men, I think Stone was the
best at anecdote. He might have written another
“Gold-headed Cane.” He was fond of his friends,
and was hospitable. He enjoyed his profession, his
consultations, and he told a story well. As a sample,
Dr. ⸺ was called at night to an old lady’s bedside,
but was so inebriated as to do little towards
ascertaining the state of the case. He retired to
the table to prescribe, but he could not; he was too
far gone to commit any remedial measures to paper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
He tried over and over again, when, in despair,
he described his own condition—“D—drunk, by
G⸺!” and left. Early on the following day he
received a summons to the lady. “Doctor,” said
she, “how did you know what was the matter with
me? and why were you so imprudent as to commit
it to paper?”</p>

<p>Amongst scientific men of the century we have
had Faraday, <i>facile princeps</i>—a man who, when he
was doing nothing at all, always looked to me as if
he was putting something in its place.</p>

<p>Stokes is the only man who has vied with
Faraday, and touched Newton in revealing to us
the invisible spectrum.</p>

<p>Then there is Tyndall still, an industrious peeper
behind the scenes. It was kind of Faraday to leave
him his old coat; but no man could wear it—no
tailor could ever make it fit another.</p>

<p>And there is Huxley, who is so great in science,
not satisfied with the comfort of believing in nothing
himself, but he must strive to share the blessing
with all—the blessing of believing in nothing but
himself.</p>

<p>Then Darwin, who has been able to climb the
hill safely, and reach the summit, with Goethe,
Oken, Lamarc, and Geoffrey St. Hilaire on his back.</p>

<p>Then there are scientific men almost too great
to be mentioned by name. These tell us the sun will
wear out within the period they assign. If I saw
them, I should suggest that the sun could not lose
energy, because its elements are indestructible. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
they asked me what I meant, I should reply that
when oxygen and carbon produced heat, and lost it
to the earth, they could produce just as much heat
again, and that for ever.</p>

<p>“Matter and force,” I should say, “are one, and
that one cannot lose or gain.”</p>

<p>If they made no answer, I should add, and then
walk away—</p>

<p>“The materials of the sun cannot be diminished,
as they can reach no other centre of gravity. But
I admit that the sun is open to collision; not, however,
within any calculable period of time.”</p>

<p>We should then both speak to some one else.</p>

<p>I now conclude.</p>

<p>In these my reminiscences I have made very
free with my reader, and now I heartily wish him
“Good day.”</p>

<h2 id="POSTSCRIPT">POSTSCRIPT.</h2>

<p>My respected publishers, now that my “Memoirs”
are in print, have asked me if I wish to precede
them by any prefatory remarks; this I have no
need of doing, since the first paragraph in the work
is a sufficient explanation of why the book was
written. But an event having happened which has
put half the nation in mourning, and perhaps most
of all our august sovereign herself, I feel impelled
to utter a few words of sympathy on that sad occasion
to her, the loss of a deserving Poet Laureate.</p>

<p>The time has come when the nation’s trust is no
longer reposed in any party, but it is to be hoped
that its confidence in the throne is unabated. It
has taken centuries to produce a sovereign Power
whose unbiased will has become moulded to the
English idea of rule, and which is in perfect accord
with the desires of our now vast numbers; and it
is ardently to be wished that a great people may
realize, under every change, that they possess one
true friend who occupies the first of the three
estates of the realm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>As an individual, part owner of these three
estates for yet a little while, I desire to leave
behind me, not the words of a laureate, but of a
loving subject of the best of sovereigns and the best
of women. If I, as a poet, have a wish that I
would see gratified, it is to hear my “Ode,” written
and published during the year of the Jubilee, sung
by loyal voices to the sound of trumpets and to the
beating of the drum! It may come in appropriately,
as by an amateur, during the present little
<i>interregnum</i>. For the perusal of those who partake
of my love for, my faith in, the throne, I give it
here entire, and once more to my readers say,
“Farewell!”</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
